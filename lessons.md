# Patent Council — lessons learned

Read by the Risk Analyst before every pre-drafting report, and by the Specification Drafter and the
Claims Architect before drafting. Each lesson is a recurring failure seen in real runs, the rule that
prevents it, and the evidence. Keep entries general: **never copy confidential invention content here.**
The Orchestrator appends new lessons after each matter (see its AGENTS.md, "Checkpoint: package").

## L1 — Negative limitations in independent claims are a gift to competitors
**Rule:** Do not put "without doing X" / "not X" limitations about an internal component in an
independent claim. If the distinction matters, claim what the component *does*, and move the negative
feature to a dependent claim with its own support paragraph.
**Why:** A competitor adds one cheap extra step and is literally outside the claim, and a negative
limitation about internal behaviour is usually provable only through source-code discovery.
**Seen:** PayAxle Guard (2026-09), the top critical finding: four independent claims fell to one
avoidable negative gate limitation.

## L2 — Support gaps are the largest category of findings
**Rule:** Every claim element must be mapped in `support-map.json` to paragraphs that exist and use its
words, and `pc support-map` must pass, before the review starts. Add disclosure; do not narrow to fit.
**Why:** 93 of 209 findings (44%) in one run were support, priority or amendment-basis gaps, found only
at the end, which forced whole loop-back cycles.

## L3 — Definite articles need an antecedent
**Rule:** Run `pc antecedent` on every claim set. "The content", "the values", "the verification",
"the time" with no earlier "a/an …" is an antecedent-basis objection waiting to happen.
**Seen:** 34 flags on one shipped claim set.

## L4 — Register every reference numeral
**Rule:** Run `pc numerals` after every description revision. Numerals added in a revision (for example
a new figure's 2202–2212 series) are the ones most often missing from the registry.
**Seen:** Six unregistered numerals in a package that reached counsel.

## L5 — Hold the locked terms, especially in revisions
**Rule:** Revisions and loop-backs drift most. A bare "stage" where the locked term is "transaction
stage" is a violation. Run `pc terms` on every revision, not only on first drafts.
**Seen:** Terminology drift in the claims revision and the abstract of the same run.

## L6 — Novelty argued against nothing is worthless
**Rule:** Phase 2 needs real references with full text. If the reference set is thin, say so in every
Phase 2 output and in the cover memo; do not let a confident novelty position rest on zero documents.
**Seen:** Two consecutive runs of the same matter had no prior art at all.

## L7 — Most single-reviewer findings are opinions, not defects
**Rule:** Adjudicate before routing. Only upheld findings (and unclear critical ones) go back for
revision; every finding is still reported with its ruling.
**Seen:** Two reviewers agreed on 2 of 209 and on 0 of 130 findings in two runs of one matter.

## L8 — Inventor questions only help if they are answerable
**Rule:** Ask the ten questions that change the claims most, as a short multiple-choice form, and keep
the run moving. A list of 140 open questions was left entirely unanswered.
