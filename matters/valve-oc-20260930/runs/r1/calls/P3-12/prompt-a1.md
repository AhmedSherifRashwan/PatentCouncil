You are the **Invention Analyst**. Follow your AGENTS.md. This message is the whole brief: what to do, the prompts to execute, every input (embedded below, so do not re-read those files), and the exact files to write.

## What to do

Run Prompt 12. Everything is a candidate until Gate 2. It runs in parallel with the other Phase 3 prompts and with the prior-art charts: use the differentiation (09) and white space (10) if they are embedded.

**Time budget:** about 10 minutes. The whole matter is planned to finish end to end in two hours. Be complete, but write each deliverable once: no drafts, no repetition, no padding.

## Prompt 12 — Equivalent architectures  (kind `drafting`)

**Write your reply to:** `/Users/ahmed/PatentCouncil/matters/valve-oc-20260930/runs/r1/P3/12.md`

*Broaden the disclosure without relying on vague boilerplate.*

For every essential-looking component or step, identify functionally equivalent architectures that could achieve the same technical purpose. Describe concrete alternative structures, materials, mechanisms, ordering, coupling, actuation, sensing, processing and manufacturing approaches. Only include technically credible alternatives.

**How to work.** Everything you produce here is a candidate: it is not specification content until the human confirms at Gate 2 that it is technically real, so label the deliverable `Status: candidate` and never present an embodiment as something the inventors have already built or tested unless the dossier says so. Use the locked terminology verbatim; a new component name goes in `new_terms` with a reason. Only technically credible alternatives; anything that needs inventor confirmation is flagged in the deliverable and in `open_questions`. Take the features classified essential or advantageous in `03` as the list to cover. Under `### Equivalent Architecture Library` use one H4 per component or step (locked preferred term), then a numbered list of alternatives each with: concrete structure or mechanism, how it achieves the same technical purpose, what changes (interfaces, ordering, materials), the genus term that would embrace both, and a credibility note. Cross-reference the `11` design-around ids an alternative would close where `11` is supplied. Boilerplate lists ('any suitable material') are not alternatives. Reply exactly in the drafting output contract: `## Deliverable` (with the H3 sections named above), `## Rationale`, `## Assumptions`, `## Open Questions`, then one final fenced `json` envelope. No preamble before `## Deliverable`; nothing after the envelope. Reuse locked preferred terms verbatim; declare any other term in `new_terms` with a reason.

## Output contract (drafting)

Your reply MUST be markdown with exactly these H2 headings, in this order, and nothing before the first one:

## Deliverable

One H3 heading per deliverable section named in the task, in the order named, each containing the finished content for that section. Only the text under `## Deliverable` is carried forward to later prompts, to the package and to the human; anything you want them to see goes here.

## Rationale

Why you drafted or analysed it this way: trade-offs, alternatives considered, how conflicts between inputs were resolved. This section is stripped before the package reaches the independent reviewer.

## Assumptions

Every assumption you made, numbered A1, A2 ..., each saying whether it blocks a later phase.

## Open Questions

Every question the dossier does not answer, numbered Q1, Q2 ..., each naming the phase(s) it blocks.

Then ONE final fenced ```json block, and nothing after it, with exactly this shape:

```json
{
  "prompt": "<id>",
  "status": "complete|partial",
  "assumptions": [{"id": "A1", "text": "...", "blocking": false}],
  "open_questions": [{"id": "Q1", "text": "...", "blocks": ["P4"]}],
  "new_terms": [{"term": "...", "maps_to": "<locked preferred term or null>", "reason": "..."}],
  "support_refs": [{"item": "...", "support": "..."}],
  "disclosure_requests": [{"limitation": "...", "needed_disclosure": "..."}],
  "open_disagreements": [{"topic": "...", "position": "..."}],
  "narrowing_suggested": []
}
```

Rules:

- `prompt` is the id of the task you were given. `status` is `partial` whenever a required input was missing or an open question stopped you finishing a section.
- The lists in the envelope must mirror the prose sections (`## Assumptions` ↔ `assumptions`, `## Open Questions` ↔ `open_questions`). Empty lists are `[]`, never omitted.
- `blocks` values are phase ids: `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4`, `P5`, `REVIEW`, `PACKAGE`.
- `support_refs` records, for every drafted item that relies on the dossier (a limitation, a range, an example, a definition), where it is supported: a paragraph number, section id, figure, intake file or earlier output.
- `disclosure_requests` is used by the claims drafter for limitations it could not support, and by the specification drafter for disclosure it needs but the confirmed embodiments do not contain. Each entry names the limitation or passage and the disclosure that would be needed.
- `open_disagreements` records a position you hold that conflicts with another agent's output in the inner loop (Phase 4 ↔ Phase 5). `narrowing_suggested` lists claim narrowings you consider necessary but did not apply; both are surfaced to the human.
- Terminology rule: reuse the locked preferred terms verbatim (once the terminology lock exists; before it, the terms used in the Phase 1 outputs). Any other term for a locked concept must be declared in `new_terms` with the locked term it maps to and a reason; an undeclared synonym or a term from the avoid list is a contract violation. `maps_to` is `null` only for a genuinely new concept.
- Write the deliverable in British spelling. No preamble, no closing remarks, no offers of further help.

## Deliverable

### Structured Invention Disclosure

This is a drafting and analysis aid prepared by AI. It is not legal advice and makes no statement about patentability; qualified patent counsel signs off before anything is filed.

**Sources.** Every technical fact below is taken from `intake/disclosure.md`, cited as §1–§9 by its section numbers. `intake/data/bench-test.md` (cited as "bench data") and `intake/drawings/README.md` (cited as "drawings README") are used as corroboration only. The two inventor sketches, FIG-1 and FIG-2, are known only from the README's one-line descriptions; the images have not been seen and nothing here describes them beyond what the README says (Q22). Anything inferred rather than read is labelled *inferred* and listed under Assumptions.

**Component names used throughout** are the inventor's own words where they are neutral, with the reference numerals given in §3 (the drawings README confirms the sketches use the same numerals): valve stem (10), core body (20), seat ring (30), poppet (40), sealing face (42), purge shoulder (44), return spring (50), purge gap (60), lock nut (70). Operating terms: *normal stroke*, *over-travel*, *crack pressure*, *over-travel threshold* (the pressure differential at which over-travel begins), *air purge* and *snap-back wipe* (the two cleaning actions), *sealant film*.

#### (a) Problem being solved

1. Riders use liquid sealant (typically a latex emulsion with ammonia and suspended particles) in bicycle inner tubes and tubeless set-ups, and inject it through the valve stem (§1).
2. On each inflation, sealant is drawn into the valve core bore "by the pressure surge and by capillary action along the poppet stem", and the film dries between rides (§1). This causal account is the inventor's own and is not separately evidenced.
3. After 10–20 inflation cycles, cured latex on the core seat causes one of two failures: the valve leaks slowly because the poppet no longer seats, or it blocks because the pump cannot open it (§1). The bench data corroborates both modes: C-1 and C-3 blocked, C-2 leaked.
4. The existing remedy is manual: unscrew the core with a tool, scrape it or replace it, and re-inject sealant. Cores are sold in multipacks for this reason (§1).
5. The inventor names existing attempts (a low-adhesion polymer coating on the poppet, an enlarged bore, a removable insert) and says they only slow build-up and do not remove a film once formed (§1). No specific product, patent or publication is identified (Q35).

#### (b) Core inventive concept

As stated in §2, read without narrowing:

1. The valve core carries a **seat ring (30)** of superelastic NiTi instead of a rigid brass seat or a rubber grommet. Its wall is thin and sinuous (convoluted) (§2, §3(3)).
2. Under normal inflation the poppet (40) lifts off the seat by its normal stroke (§2).
3. When the pump applies a pressure differential above a threshold, the poppet moves beyond its normal stroke. This is **over-travel** (§2).
4. Over-travel drives the **purge shoulder (44)** of the poppet against the seat ring. The ring flexes radially outward and opens an annular **purge gap (60)** (§2, §3(4), §3(6)).
5. Air at pump pressure flows through the purge gap "across the exact surfaces on which sealant accumulates" and blows the sealant film into the tube. This is the **air purge** (§2). The drawings README says FIG-2 shows air flowing both "through the main passage and through the purge gap into the tube".
6. When the pump head is removed, the differential collapses, the poppet returns and the seat ring recovers its shape. Because superelastic recovery is fast and stiff rather than a slow elastomer creep, the recovering ring wipes across the poppet face with a snap and shears off partially cured latex. This is the **snap-back wipe** (§2).
7. The inventor describes this as cleaning "twice per inflation": once by the air purge and once by the snap-back wipe (§2).

Observations for Prompt 03, not conclusions. The inventor's own alternatives (§6) replace NiTi with PEEK (Alternative A) and separate the sealing seat from a stainless spring wiper ring (Alternative B). On the face of the disclosure, then, the inventor conceives the invention more broadly than "a NiTi seat ring". Four elements recur across §2 and §6:
- (i) poppet movement beyond a normal opening stroke at a higher pressure differential;
- (ii) a resiliently deflectable ring element that a shoulder on the poppet contacts during that over-travel;
- (iii) a purge flow path opened by that deflection;
- (iv) recovery of the ring element on release.

Whether each of (i)–(iv) is essential is for the inventor to confirm (Q6, Q12, Q24).

#### (c) Technical effect

1. **Stated effect:** the valve "keeps sealing and keeps opening after far more sealant-loaded inflation cycles than a conventional core, with no tool and no rider action" (§2).
2. **Stated mechanisms:** the air purge removes sealant film through the purge gap, and the snap-back wipe shears off partially cured latex (§2). The inventor contrasts the wipe with a rubber seat, in which latex "would simply embed itself", and attributes the wipe to superelastic recovery being "fast and stiff" (§2).
3. **Evidence of the effect:** all three prototypes completed 40 cycles without failure, while all three conventional cores failed between cycles 12 and 18 (§8). Details are under (l).
4. **Not evidenced:**
   - how much each of the air purge and the snap-back wipe contributes;
   - a direct measurement of over-travel distance or purge-gap opening. Over-travel was inferred from an audible snap (bench data).

   See Q23 and Q24.

#### (d) Essential components/steps

The disclosure does not itself label components essential or optional. The table records what §2 needs for the stated mechanism to work. The "needed" column is *inferred* from §2 and §6 and awaits Prompt 03 and the inventor.

| # | Component (ref) | Function stated in the disclosure | Needed for the §2 mechanism? (*inferred*) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Core body (20) | Threaded to the stem; carries the seat ring; guides the poppet | Yes, as carrier and guide. Material and form are open | §3(2) |
| D2 | Seat ring (30) | Sealing seat (upper edge). Deflects radially outward under over-travel to open the purge gap. Recovers with a snap to wipe the poppet face | Yes. NiTi is preferred; §6 Alternatives A and B show the inventor considers non-NiTi ring elements | §2, §3(3), §6 |
| D3 | Convoluted wall of the seat ring | One or two shallow convolutions, so that axial load on the upper edge becomes radial expansion | Stated as the mechanism of radial expansion. Whether a straight-walled ring could work is not addressed (Q12) | §3(3) |
| D4 | Poppet (40) with sealing face (42) | Moving valve member; its conical sealing face seats on the upper edge of the seat ring | Yes | §3(4) |
| D5 | Purge shoulder (44) | Below the sealing face; contacts the seat ring only during over-travel | Yes | §2, §3(4) |
| D6 | Return spring (50), two-rate | Soft first stage for normal opening; stiffer second stage that the pump differential must overcome to reach over-travel | Some means of setting an over-travel threshold is needed. Whether a two-rate spring is the only means is not addressed (Q6) | §3(5) |
| D7 | Purge gap (60) | Annular clearance, closed at rest, opened by ring expansion; carries the air purge | Yes. **Its location is stated inconsistently** (Q1, Q2) | §2, §3(6) |

Operating sequence, as described in §2 (not presented as a method claim):

| Step | Event | Source |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | The pump head applies pressure. At the crack pressure the poppet lifts off the seat ring by its normal stroke (first spring stage) | §2, §3(5), §4 |
| S2 | The pressure differential exceeds the over-travel threshold. The poppet over-travels against the second spring stage | §2, §3(5), §4 |
| S3 | The purge shoulder bears on the seat ring; the ring flexes radially outward; the purge gap opens | §2, §3(4), §3(6); drawings README (FIG-2) |
| S4 | Air at pump pressure flows through the purge gap across the sealant-bearing surfaces into the tube (air purge). Air also flows through the main passage | §2; drawings README (FIG-2) |
| S5 | The pump head is removed; the differential collapses; the poppet returns; the ring recovers and wipes the poppet face (snap-back wipe); the purge gap closes | §2; bench data (audible snap on pump-head removal) |

#### (e) Optional components

| Component | Status in the disclosure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Lock nut (70) | Conventional; closes the poppet manually for storage and transport. Not part of the mechanism | §3(7) |
| Valve stem (10) | Conventional Presta-pattern brass stem, 6 mm OD, with a threaded bore. The mechanism is in the core. The disclosure does not say whether the core alone is a product, for example a replacement core for existing stems (Q33) | §3(1) |
| Electropolished ring surface | Manufacturing step that removes oxide and the heat-affected edge. Its functional importance (for example to the wipe or to fatigue life) is not stated | §5, §7 |
| Spring material | "Nothing in the concept depends on the spring material" | §5 |

#### (f) Alternative implementations

All are as stated in the disclosure. None has been built or tested except where the table says so.

| # | Alternative | What changes | Inventor's stated trade-off | Built/tested | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Stainless 303 core body | Core body material, for corrosion resistance with ammonia-bearing sealant | — | "was also machined". The bench data lists no stainless variant (Q18) | §5 |
| F2 | Hard-anodised aluminium sealing face on the poppet | Material of the poppet and sealing face | "considered" | No; the prototype poppet is brass | §5 |
| F3 | Alternative A: PEEK seat ring with the same convoluted wall | Seat ring material | Cheaper and gives some radial compliance, but recovery is slower and snap-back force lower, so the wipe is weaker. Proposed for a lower-cost line | No | §6 |
| F4 | Alternative B: two-piece seat. A rigid brass seat does the sealing; a separate thin stainless spring wiper ring below it is deflected outward by the purge shoulder | Separates sealing from purge and wipe | Possibly easier to make, at the cost of one more part and more axial length | No | §6 |
| F5 | Thermal variant: a two-way shape-memory NiTi ring (Af about 35–40 °C) that opens the purge gap when warmed by hand, for a manual purge without a pump | Actuation by temperature instead of over-travel | Inventor is "not sure this is worth pursuing"; no data | No | §6 |
| F6 | One or two convolutions in the ring wall | Ring geometry | — | The disclosure does not say which count the prototype used (Q11) | §3(3) |

The disclosure contains no other alternatives. It does not mention other alloys, other ring geometries, other threshold mechanisms, or Schrader and other valve types (Q14, Q26).

#### (g) Inputs/outputs

| Input | Output | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Pump-side pressure below crack pressure | Valve closed. The poppet sealing face rests on the upper edge of the seat ring; the purge gap is closed | §3(4), §3(6); drawings README (FIG-1) |
| Pressure differential at or above crack pressure (prototype 1.0 bar) | Normal stroke (prototype 0.6 mm). Air flows into the tube past the sealing face | §2, §4 |
| Pressure differential at or above the over-travel threshold (prototype 3.5 bar) | Over-travel (prototype 0.5 mm). The ring expands, the purge gap opens (prototype 0.15 mm radial) and the air purge runs | §2, §4; drawings README (FIG-2) |
| Pump head removed | The poppet returns, the ring recovers, the snap-back wipe occurs and the purge gap closes. The bench data reports an audible snap | §2; bench data |
| Lock nut operated by hand | Poppet held closed for storage and transport | §3(7) |
| Deflation "through the valve" (test protocol) | Tube emptied. The mechanism during deflation is not described (Q23) | §8 |

The disclosure does not define "pressure differential". Pump side against tube side is *inferred* (A3, Q4).

#### (h) Materials, dimensions, ranges and operating conditions

The disclosure labels the §4 values "prototype values, with the ranges we believe would work". Only the prototype value was built, and **no range endpoint is evidenced** (Q15).

| Parameter | Prototype value | Range given by inventor | Evidence | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Seat ring inner diameter | 2.3 mm | 2.0–2.6 mm | Prototype only | §4 |
| Seat ring wall thickness | 0.20 mm | 0.15–0.30 mm | Prototype only | §4, §7 |
| Seat ring outer diameter | 2.7 mm (*inferred* from the tube stock in §7) | Not given | — | §7 (A2) |
| Seat ring free length | 3.0 mm | 2.5–4.0 mm | Prototype only | §4 |
| Convolution amplitude | 0.12 mm | 0.08–0.20 mm | Prototype only | §4 |
| Number of convolutions | "one or two" | — | Prototype count not stated | §3(3) |
| Normal poppet stroke | 0.6 mm | Not given | Prototype only | §4 |
| Over-travel beyond the normal stroke | 0.5 mm | 0.4–0.9 mm | Prototype only; not measured in the test | §4 |
| Purge gap, fully open | 0.15 mm radial | 0.10–0.25 mm | Prototype value; not measured in the test | §4 |
| Crack pressure (first spring stage) | 1.0 bar | 0.8–1.5 bar | Prototype only | §4 |
| Over-travel threshold (second spring stage) | 3.5 bar | 2.5–5.0 bar | Prototype only | §4 |
| NiTi austenite finish temperature Af | "below 5 °C" (specified) | Upper bound only. No lower bound; As, Ms and Mf not given | A specification, not a measured value | §4 |
| NiTi composition | Nominally 55.8 wt% Ni | No tolerance | — | §5 |
| Ring press fit in the core body | Interference of approx. 0.03 mm on diameter | Not given | Prototype | §7 |
| Valve stem outer diameter | 6 mm (Presta-pattern) | — | Conventional | §3(1) |
| Test inflation pressure | 6 bar | — | Test condition | §8 |
| Test hold temperature | 22 °C | — | Test condition | §8 |
| Thermal variant Af | about 35–40 °C | — | No data | §6 |

Materials:

| Part | Prototype | Alternatives disclosed | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seat ring (30) | Superelastic NiTi from drawn tube, shape-set and electropolished | PEEK (F3); stainless spring wiper ring with a brass seat (F4); two-way shape-memory NiTi (F5) | §5, §6 |
| Core body (20) and stem (10) | Free-machining brass CW614N | Stainless 303 (F1) | §5 |
| Poppet (40) | Brass | Hard-anodised aluminium sealing face (F2) | §5 |
| Return spring (50) | Stainless music wire | Material stated to be immaterial | §5 |

Operating conditions:
- **Stated:** "all riding temperatures" (§4; no temperature range given); ammonia-bearing latex sealant (§1, §5); floor-pump inflation (§2, §8).
- **Expressly unknown:** CO2 inflation, ammonia-free sealants and long service (§9). The bench data adds that no fatigue or cold-shock testing was done.

The disclosure does not give:
- the core body bore diameter at the ring;
- the geometry of the purge shoulder;
- the cone angle of the sealing face;
- spring rates, forces, or the stroke at which the second stage engages;
- what limits over-travel (a stop, coil-bind or the ring);
- the axial position of the ring against the internal shoulder.

See Q7, Q8, Q9, Q16 and Q36.

#### (i) Control logic/software

There is no software and no electronics. Control is entirely mechanical and actuated by pressure (§2, §3(5)):

| State | Condition | Poppet | Seat ring | Purge gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Closed | Differential below crack pressure | Seated on the upper edge of the ring | At rest | Closed |
| Normal open | Differential between crack pressure and the over-travel threshold; first spring stage | Normal stroke | Not contacted by the purge shoulder | Closed |
| Purge | Differential above the over-travel threshold; second spring stage overcome | Over-travel | Deflected radially outward by the purge shoulder | Open |
| Recovery | Differential collapses when the pump head is removed | Returns | Superelastic recovery; snap-back wipe | Closes |
| Locked | Lock nut closed | Held closed | — | — |

The two-rate return spring sets the threshold (§3(5)). The disclosure does not say how much the ring's own stiffness contributes to it (Q6, Q7).

#### (j) Manufacturing methods

The prototype process, from §7:

1. Seat ring: laser-cut from NiTi tube (2.7 mm OD, 0.20 mm wall) "to the convoluted profile on a mandrel". It is ambiguous whether the convolution comes from the laser cut, from forming on the mandrel or from the shape-set fixture (Q11).
2. Shape-set at 500 °C for 10 minutes in a fixture that holds the wave geometry, then water-quenched.
3. Electropolished to remove the oxide and the heat-affected edge.
4. Pressed into the core body with an interference of approximately 0.03 mm on diameter and seated against the internal shoulder.
5. Core body and poppet: ordinary turning, with "no other special process".

The disclosure gives no process ranges and no volume-production route. It also names no alternative forming routes (for example stamping, etching or rolling a corrugated tube) and no alternative ways of retaining the ring (adhesive, crimp, snap feature) (Q17, Q32).

#### (k) Use cases

**Stated:**
- bicycle inner tubes with liquid sealant, and tubeless set-ups with sealant (§1);
- floor-pump inflation (§2, §8);
- a lower-cost product line using the PEEK ring (§6);
- manual purging without a pump, in the thermal variant (§6).

The test used 700×28 inner tubes (§8).

**Not stated:**
- testing in a tubeless set-up (only inner tubes were tested);
- Schrader valves or other vehicle tyres;
- other valves that carry sealant or are prone to fouling;
- sale of the core alone as a retrofit.

See Q25, Q26 and Q33.

#### (l) Experimental evidence

The bench test ran from 2026-08-12 to 2026-08-20 (§8, corroborated by the bench data):

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Samples | 3 prototype cores (P-1 to P-3). 3 conventional cores (C-1 to C-3), all the same manufacturer's standard Presta core; the manufacturer is not named | §8; bench data |
| Set-up | Identical 700×28 tubes, each charged with 60 ml of latex sealant. The sealant product and ammonia content are not stated | §8 |
| Cycle | Inflate to 6 bar with a floor pump; hold 24 h at 22 °C; deflate fully through the valve; repeat | §8 |
| Failure criterion | Leak-down > 0.5 bar in 24 h, or the pump fails to open the valve within 5 s of engagement | §8 |
| Inflation-time measure | From pump-head engagement to 6 bar, with the same pump and the same operator throughout | bench data |
| Conventional results | C-1: blocked at cycle 14 (inflation time 41 s at cycle 1, 68 s at cycle 13). C-2: leak-down of 0.7 bar at cycle 12 (40 s, then 44 s at cycle 11). C-3: blocked at cycle 18 (42 s, then 75 s at cycle 17) | §8; bench data |
| Prototype results | No failure in 40 cycles. Inflation time, cycle 1 → cycle 40: P-1 43 → 47 s; P-2 41 → 46 s; P-3 44 → 50 s. Leak-down at cycle 40: 0.1, 0.1 and 0.2 bar/24 h. The disclosure states that mean inflation time at cycle 40 was within 15 % of cycle 1 | §8; bench data |
| Over-travel indicator | "Over-travel was confirmed on every prototype inflation by an audible snap on pump-head removal." This is indirect: it indicates a recovery event, not a measured over-travel distance or purge-gap opening | bench data |
| Post-test inspection | Under a stereo microscope at cycle 40: cured film on the outer surface of the ring in the purge-gap region; sealing edge and poppet face clean | §8; bench data |
| Not tested | Fatigue and cold shock | §9; bench data |

The limits of the evidence, stated without judging it:
- the sample is small (n = 3 of each);
- the test used one sealant, one temperature, one inflation pressure, one floor pump, one operator, and inner tubes only;
- the test stopped at 40 cycles rather than running the prototypes to failure;
- over-travel and purge-gap opening were not measured directly;
- no test isolated the air purge from the snap-back wipe;
- Alternatives A, B, F1, F2 and F5 were not tested.

The rising inflation times of the conventional cores before failure, including the leaking core C-2, are recorded in the bench data but not discussed in the disclosure. Against a commercial target of "several thousand" cycles, §9 records 40 over-travel cycles per ring (Q23, Q24, Q27).

#### (m) Unresolved technical questions

The inventor's own known unknowns (§9):
- the fatigue life of the seat ring, and whether the purge gap stays closed after long service (Q27);
- whether chilling from a CO2 inflator takes the ring below its martensite start temperature, and whether Af below 5 °C is enough margin (Q28);
- whether the effect holds with ammonia-free sealants (Q29).

Gaps and inconsistencies found during extraction (each is a numbered open question below):

- **The purge gap's location is stated two ways:** "between the ring and the stem bore" (§2) and "between the seat ring outer surface and the core body bore" (§3(6)). The bench data (film on the ring's outer surface in the purge-gap region) is consistent with the §3(6) reading (Q1).
- **The gap-opening mechanism is not self-evidently consistent.** The ring is pressed into the core body with an interference fit (§7) and "flexes radially outward" (§2). Yet a gap is said to open between its outer surface and the core body bore (§3(6)), whereas outward expansion would ordinarily close a gap at the outer surface, not open it. The complete air path from the pump side, through the purge gap, to the tube is not described in words. FIG-2 is said to show it, but the image is not in the dossier (Q2, Q22). This bears directly on enablement.
- The direction of poppet travel, and the meaning of "upper", "below" and "under" (Q3).
- The definition of the pressure differential, and when over-travel occurs during an inflation (Q4). The basis for saying "every floor pump reaches" the threshold (Q5).
- Whether the two-rate spring is essential, and its construction and rates (Q6, Q7).
- The geometry of the purge shoulder, the sealing face and the wipe (Q8, Q9, Q10). The form of the convolution and whether it is essential (Q11, Q12).
- The NiTi transformation temperatures and composition tolerance, and whether other alloys would work (Q13, Q14).
- The basis for each §4 range (Q15). The core body bore and the ring OD (Q16). How the ring is retained (Q17).
- The status of alternatives F1–F5 (Q18–Q21).
- The sketch images, which are absent (Q22). Details of the bench test that the data does not give (Q23). How the effect divides between the two cleaning actions (Q24).
- Tubeless use, other valve types, and sale as a retrofit core (Q25, Q26, Q33).
- The film found in the purge-gap region and its long-term effect (Q30). The sealing path at rest (Q31). Manufacturing alternatives and process windows (Q32).
- Prior public disclosure, use or sale of the prototypes (Q34). Prior solutions known to the inventor (Q35). What limits over-travel (Q36).

## Rationale

I treated §2 as the inventor's statement of the concept and §3–§8 as the embodiment, and kept them apart. That lets Prompt 03 build the nucleus ladder from §2 and §6 rather than from the prototype. The §6 alternatives matter disproportionately because they show the inventor already sees two things as open: the ring element need not be NiTi, and sealing and wiping can be separated. I therefore recorded the recurring elements (i)–(iv) in (b) as an observation, not as the nucleus.

As the brief requires, the bench data and the drawings README are used only as corroboration. Specifically:
- The per-core figures are reproduced in (l) because Prompt 03 and the Description will need them.
- The "audible snap" is recorded as an indirect indicator of over-travel, not as a measurement.
- The mean-inflation-time statement in §8 is quoted from the disclosure, not recomputed as a new fact.
- The sketches are cited only through the README's own words. The images are not in the dossier and I have not described them.

The most consequential finding is the inconsistency over the purge gap:
- §2 and §3(6) name different bores.
- The interference fit in §7 is hard to reconcile with a gap opening at the ring's outer surface when the ring expands outward.
- The README's description of FIG-2 confirms that there is a purge flow path, but it does not describe the mechanism.

I did not resolve this with a plausible mechanism, such as a fit over only part of the ring's length or the ring's edge lifting axially, because either reading would be an invented fact. The point is captured in Q1 and Q2, which should be the inventor's first questions: the Description cannot enable the air purge without the answer.

Every §4 range is marked "believed", not evidenced, because the inventor says so. This sets how far the Phase 3 ladders can go without inventor confirmation.

The inventor's name is labelled fictional and concerns inventorship, so it is not flagged as unrelated personal data. No third-party personal data appears. The test operator is not named.

This file replaces the earlier P1a output at the same path, which was written when `intake/data/` and `intake/drawings/` were empty. The questions have been renumbered: the earlier Q22 (missing bench data) is resolved, and the drawings question is now Q22.

## Assumptions

A1. "Presta-pattern" (§3(1)) is read as meaning the stem and core are dimensioned to work with conventional Presta pump heads and rims. *Inferred.* Not blocking.

A2. The prototype seat ring's outer diameter is taken as 2.7 mm. This is *inferred* from the tube stock in §7 (2.7 mm OD, 0.20 mm wall), which is consistent with the 2.3 mm ID in §4. The disclosure does not state the ring OD. Not blocking; confirm at Gate 1.

A3. "Pressure differential" (§2, §4) is read as the difference between pump-side pressure and tube-side pressure across the poppet. *Inferred.* Blocks P4 and P5 until Q4 is answered.

A4. "Upper" (§3(4)) is read as the pump or outer side, and "below"/"under" (§3(4), §3(5)) as the tube side. *Inferred from conventional valve orientation.* Blocks P4 (figure descriptions) until Q3 is answered.

A5. The poppet is taken to open and over-travel by moving towards the tube interior. *Inferred.* Blocks P4 until Q3 is answered.

A6. The two cleaning actions (air purge and snap-back wipe) are treated as the inventor's explanation of the mechanism. The bench test evidences the outcome, not how it divides between the two. Not blocking for P2; relevant to P3 and P5 through Q24.

A7. The three prototype cores are taken to share the §4 prototype values. *Inferred:* neither the disclosure nor the bench data says whether they differed. Not blocking.

A8. "Twice per inflation" (§2) is read as once per inflation event (from pump-head engagement to removal), not per pump stroke. *Inferred.* The bench data's audible snap "on pump-head removal" is consistent with this reading. Not blocking for P2; tied to Q4 for P4.

A9. The audible snap reported in the bench data is taken as indirect evidence that over-travel and recovery occurred at the test conditions (inflation from fully deflated to 6 bar, floor pump). It is not taken as evidence of over-travel distance, purge-gap size, or over-travel at other tube pressures. Not blocking; relevant to Q4 and Q23.

## Open Questions

Q1. Where is the purge gap (60)? §2 places it between the seat ring and "the stem bore"; §3(6) places it between the seat ring's outer surface and "the core body bore". Which is correct, or are both involved? Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q2. How does the purge gap open when the seat ring is pressed into the core body with about 0.03 mm interference (§7) and expands radially outward (§2)? Which portion of the ring is in the interference fit, which surface moves away from which, and what is the full air path from the pump side through the purge gap into the tube? Please describe it in words, in addition to FIG-2. Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q3. In which direction does the poppet move to open and to over-travel, and what do "upper", "below" and "under" refer to (pump side or tube side)? Blocks P4.

Q4. How is the over-travel pressure differential defined: pump side minus tube side, static or a transient surge? The test inflated from fully deflated. Does over-travel also occur when topping up a tube already near its target pressure, and does it occur on every pump stroke or only once per inflation? Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q5. What is the basis for saying "every floor pump reaches" the threshold (§2)? The test used one floor pump. Does over-travel occur with hand pumps, CO2 inflators and compressors? Blocks P3, P4.

Q6. Is the two-rate return spring essential, or could the over-travel threshold be set by other means, for example a single-rate spring plus the seat ring's own stiffness, a second spring, or a detent? Is the prototype's second stage a variable-pitch spring, two springs, or something else? Blocks P3, P5.

Q7. What are the spring rates or forces of each stage, and at what stroke does the second stage engage? Does engagement coincide with the purge shoulder contacting the seat ring? Blocks P3, P4.

Q8. What is the geometry of the purge shoulder (form, diameter)? Where on the seat ring does it bear (upper edge or inner surface), and what is its axial clearance to the ring at rest and at the end of the normal stroke? Blocks P4.

Q9. What is the cone angle of the sealing face (42)? Is the at-rest seal metal-to-metal (brass poppet on the edge of the NiTi ring), with no elastomer anywhere in the seal path? Blocks P4.

Q10. In the snap-back wipe, which surface of the seat ring moves across which part of the poppet face, in what direction and over what distance? Blocks P3, P4.

Q11. Did the prototype ring have one or two convolutions? What are the convolution's profile and orientation? Is the wave produced by the laser cut, by forming on the mandrel or by the shape-set fixture (§7 is ambiguous)? Blocks P3, P4.

Q12. Would a straight-walled ring (no convolution), or another geometry that converts axial load into radial movement, work? Is the convolution essential? Blocks P3, P5.

Q13. What are the ring's As, Ms and Mf temperatures? What Af was actually achieved, and how was it measured? Is there a lower bound on Af? Blocks P3, P4.

Q14. What tolerance applies to the 55.8 wt% Ni composition, and has the inventor conceived other superelastic alloys (for example ternary NiTi alloys or copper-based alloys)? Blocks P3.

Q15. The §4 ranges are "ranges we believe would work". Which of them, if any, rest on tests, calculation or experience beyond the prototype value? Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q16. What is the core body bore diameter at the seat ring, and what is the ring's actual OD? Blocks P4.

Q17. What range of interference fit works? Has the inventor conceived other ways of retaining the ring (adhesive, crimp, snap feature, integral forming)? Blocks P3, P4.

Q18. Was the stainless 303 core body built into a working core and tested? The bench data lists only brass-body prototypes, by implication. Blocks P4.

Q19. Was the hard-anodised aluminium sealing face built? Are other poppet materials or coatings conceived? Blocks P3.

Q20. Does the inventor regard Alternative A (PEEK ring) and Alternative B (brass seat plus stainless wiper ring) as within the invention? For B: what are the wiper ring's form and thickness, and how is it retained? Are other polymers conceived? Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q21. Should the thermal two-way shape-memory variant (§6) be included as an embodiment, given the inventor's doubt and the absence of data? Blocks P3, P4.

Q22. The images of the sketches FIG-1 (at rest) and FIG-2 (full over-travel) are not in the dossier; only the README describes them. Please supply them. Are there, or can there be, sketches of the normal-stroke state, the snap-back wipe and Alternatives A and B? Blocks P4, PACKAGE.

Q23. Bench-test details that the data does not give:
- the sealant product and its ammonia content;
- how each tube was deflated "through the valve" (lock nut, manual poppet press), and whether deflation triggered over-travel;
- whether over-travel or purge-gap opening was ever measured directly, beyond the audible snap;
- whether the rising inflation times of the conventional cores were caused by partial blockage.

Blocks P4.

Q24. Has any test separated the air-purge effect from the snap-back wipe? Which does the inventor believe is necessary, and would either alone suffice? Blocks P3, P5.

Q25. Has the valve been used or tested in a tubeless set-up? Blocks P3, P4.

Q26. Has the inventor conceived use in Schrader or other valve types, in other tyres (motorcycle, car, wheelchair), or in other fluid valves prone to fouling? Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q27. What is the seat ring's fatigue life beyond 40 over-travel cycles? Does residual strain build up, and does the purge gap stay closed at rest after long service (§9 item 1; the bench data confirms no fatigue testing)? Blocks P3, P4.

Q28. Under CO2 inflation, does chilling take the ring below Ms, and does it stay deformed until it warms (§9 item 2; the bench data confirms no cold-shock testing)? Blocks P3, P4.

Q29. Does the effect hold with ammonia-free sealants (§9)? Blocks P3, P4.

Q30. After 40 cycles, cured film was found on the ring's outer surface in the purge-gap region (§8; bench data). Does it build up over longer service, and could it stop the purge gap opening or closing? Has any mitigation been conceived? Blocks P3.

Q31. At rest, is the sealing face on the ring's edge the only seal, or must the ring's outer surface also seal against the core body (that is, is the closed purge gap airtight)? Blocks P4.

Q32. Manufacturing windows and alternatives: the laser-cut parameters; shape-set temperature and time ranges beyond 500 °C for 10 minutes; the depth removed by electropolishing; and any alternative forming routes conceived for the ring (stamping, etching, rolling, drawing a corrugated tube). Blocks P3, P4.

Q33. Is the core (parts 20–60) intended to be sold on its own as a replacement core for conventional Presta stems? Blocks P3, P5.

Q34. Before filing, has anyone shown the prototypes, the concept or the test results in public, used them in public, offered them for sale or published them? Grace-period treatment differs between the US, the EPO and the UK. Blocks P2, PACKAGE.

Q35. Can the inventor identify the existing coated-poppet, enlarged-bore and removable-insert products or documents referred to in §1? Blocks P2.

Q36. What limits over-travel to 0.5 mm in the prototype: a mechanical stop, coil-bind of the spring, or the seat ring itself? Blocks P4.

## Deliverable

### Inventive Nucleus

This analysis was drafted by AI to help with drafting. It is not legal advice and says nothing about whether the invention is patentable. Qualified patent counsel must sign off before anything is filed.

**Sources.** `intake/disclosure.md` is cited as §1–§9, `runs/r1/P1/01.md` as "01 (x)", and `intake/data/bench-test.md` as "bench data". Terms are those used in 01. Three new terms are declared in the envelope:
- **ring element**: the genus covering the seat ring (30) and the inventor's alternative ring parts;
- **threshold arrangement**: the genus covering the two-rate return spring (50) as the thing that sets the over-travel threshold;
- **main passage**: the name the drawings README uses for the normal air path.

Where a classification below is provisional, it is labelled so and tied to an assumption and a Gate 1 question.

**N0 — nucleus (minimum combination, provisional).** A valve core for a tyre that holds liquid sealant, in which:
- (a) the poppet (40) opens the main passage by a normal stroke at the crack pressure;
- (b) a threshold arrangement holds the poppet at its normal stroke until the pressure differential exceeds a higher over-travel threshold, above which the poppet moves beyond its normal stroke (over-travel);
- (c) during over-travel only, the purge shoulder (44) of the poppet bears on a resiliently deflectable ring element and deflects it;
- (d) that deflection opens a purge gap (60), closed at rest, through which inflation air flows across the surfaces on which sealant accumulates and into the tyre (air purge);
- (e) when the pressure differential collapses, the ring element recovers its shape and the purge gap closes.

Why this is the minimum:
- (a)–(e) is the combination common to the §2 concept and to both of the inventor's considered alternatives in §6: Alternative A, a PEEK ring with the same convoluted wall, and Alternative B, a brass seat plus a stainless spring wiper ring "deflected outward by the purge shoulder".
- Nothing narrower is shared by all three.
- The thermal two-way variant (§6) replaces over-travel with warming by hand. It therefore sits outside N0. It is a separate candidate concept pending Q12, and it is not a rung on this ladder.

**N0 enablement caution.** Element (d) is essential, but as the disclosure stands it is not enabled. The location of the purge gap is stated two ways (§2 says the "stem bore"; §3(6) says the "core body bore"). An outward-flexing ring that is interference-fitted in the core body (§7) would ordinarily close a gap at its outer surface rather than open one (01 (m); 01 Q1, Q2). Until the inventor describes the air path in words, the nucleus cannot be written up as enabled (Q2).

**Alternative nucleus reading, pending Q1.** The inventor describes two cleaning actions, and the bench test does not separate them (01 (c), (l); A6 of 01):
- If the inventor confirms that the air purge alone produces the effect, N0 stands as written.
- If the snap-back wipe alone suffices, the minimum would instead be (a)–(c) + (e) + the wipe, and (d) would become advantageous.
- If both are needed, N1 becomes the nucleus.

This is recorded as a question (Q1), not as an embodiment.

**The ladder.** Each rung adds features to the one before.

1. **N1 = N0 + snap-back wipe.** On recovery, the ring element moves across the poppet face and shears off the sealant film (§2). This is still common to the NiTi ring and to Alternative A (§6, with a weaker wipe). Whether it holds for Alternative B's wiper ring is unstated (Q7).
2. **N2 = N1 + the ring element is also the seat.** The sealing face (42) of the poppet seats on the upper edge of the ring element, so a single part both seals and purges (§3(3), §3(4)). This rung covers the prototype and Alternative A. It excludes Alternative B (§6).
3. **N3 = N2 + convoluted wall.** The ring element is a short tube whose wall has one or two shallow convolutions. These convert axial load from the purge shoulder into radial outward expansion (§3(3)). This rung still covers Alternative A, which has "the same convoluted wall" (§6).
4. **N4 = N3 + superelastic alloy.** The ring element is a superelastic alloy, specifically superelastic NiTi, with Af below 5 °C so that it is superelastic at all riding temperatures (§2, §4, §5). This gives the "fast and stiff" recovery that the inventor credits for the strength of the wipe (§2). It excludes Alternative A.
5. **N5 = N4 + two-rate return spring (50).** A soft first stage sets the crack pressure and a stiffer second stage sets the over-travel threshold (§3(5)).
6. **N6 = N5 + the inventor's believed ranges (§4; none evidenced beyond the prototype value, 01 (h), Q13):**
   - crack pressure 0.8–1.5 bar;
   - over-travel threshold 2.5–5.0 bar;
   - over-travel 0.4–0.9 mm;
   - purge gap fully open 0.10–0.25 mm radial;
   - ring element inner diameter 2.0–2.6 mm, wall 0.15–0.30 mm, free length 2.5–4.0 mm;
   - convolution amplitude 0.08–0.20 mm.
7. **N7 = N6 + the prototype values and process:**
   - crack pressure 1.0 bar; threshold 3.5 bar; normal stroke 0.6 mm; over-travel 0.5 mm; purge gap 0.15 mm;
   - ring inner diameter 2.3 mm, wall 0.20 mm, free length 3.0 mm, convolution amplitude 0.12 mm;
   - NiTi nominally 55.8 wt% Ni, laser-cut from 2.7 mm OD tube, shape-set at 500 °C for 10 minutes, water-quenched and electropolished;
   - ring pressed in with about 0.03 mm interference against an internal shoulder of the core body (20);
   - core body in brass CW614N; valve stem (10) Presta-pattern, 6 mm; lock nut (70) (§3–§5, §7).

This order puts the rungs that keep the inventor's own alternatives in scope ahead of the rungs that exclude them. As a result, each exclusion (Alternative B at N2, Alternative A at N4) happens as late as the disclosure allows.

### Feature Classification

"Provisional" means the disclosure does not say whether the feature is essential. Each provisional entry is tied to an assumption (A) and a Gate 1 question (Q).

| # | Feature | Rung | Classification | Why (support) | Omission risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Poppet (40) opens the main passage by a normal stroke at the crack pressure | N0 | Conventional (necessary context) | This is how any valve core works (§1: the "standard remedy" and "conventional core" context; §3(4); 01 (d) D4) | Technical effect: without it there is no valve |
| C2 | Over-travel: the poppet moves beyond its normal stroke above the over-travel threshold | N0 | Essential | §2 defines the concept by over-travel. The same actuation appears in Alternatives A and B (§6). Bench data: an audible snap on every prototype inflation | Technical effect |
| C3 | Threshold arrangement separating the normal stroke from over-travel (generic) | N0 | Essential, provisional (A3) | §2 ("above a threshold"); §3(5). The disclosure does not say whether a poppet that over-travels on every opening would work (Q3) | Technical effect: unknown, pending Q3 |
| C4 | Purge shoulder (44) on the poppet, bearing on the ring element only during over-travel | N0 | Essential | §2; §3(4). Alternative B keeps it (§6). Its geometry is unstated (01 Q8) | Technical effect |
| C5 | Resiliently deflectable ring element, deflected by the purge shoulder | N0 | Essential (genus provisional, A1) | §2; §3(3). §6 extends the genus to PEEK and to a stainless spring wiper ring. Elastomers are not conceived and are disparaged for the wipe (§2) (Q6) | Technical effect |
| C6 | Purge gap (60), closed at rest and opened by the deflection | N0 | Essential (provisional against the wipe-only reading, A2) | §2; §3(6). Bench data: film found "in the purge-gap region". **Its location and opening mechanism are inconsistent in the disclosure** (01 Q1, Q2) | **Enablement** and technical effect |
| C7 | Air purge: inflation air flows through the purge gap across the surfaces on which sealant accumulates, into the tyre | N0 | Essential, provisional (A2) | §2; the drawings README (FIG-2) via 01 (b)5. Its share of the effect is unevidenced (01 Q24) | Technical effect; **enablement** until the air path is described (Q2) |
| C8 | Recovery of the ring element when the differential collapses, closing the purge gap | N0 | Essential | §2. Bench data: snap on pump-head removal; leak-down ≤ 0.2 bar at cycle 40. Whether the closed gap must be airtight is unstated (Q11) | Technical effect (possible leak-down, or no further cycles) |
| C9 | Snap-back wipe: the recovering ring element moves across the poppet face | N1 | Advantageous, provisional (A2) | §2 (cleaning "twice"). §6: the PEEK wipe is weaker, yet PEEK is still offered for a product line. Bench data: the poppet face was clean at cycle 40 | Technical effect: unknown, pending Q1 |
| C10 | Ring element also forms the seat for the sealing face (42) | N2 | Advantageous | §3(3), §3(4). Alternative B separates sealing from purging, at the cost of one more part and more axial length (§6) | None: Alternative B shows another route |
| C11 | Conical sealing face (42) | N2 | Conventional / exemplary | §3(4). Cone angle unstated (01 Q9) | None |
| C12 | Convoluted wall with one or two shallow convolutions, converting axial load into radial expansion | N3 | Advantageous, provisional (A4) | §3(3) states it as the expansion mechanism. No other geometry is disclosed (01 Q12) | **Enablement**: if it is omitted and no other axial-to-radial geometry is disclosed, the deflection is not enabled (Q4) |
| C13 | Deflection is radially outward | N3 | Advantageous, provisional (A4) | §2 ("flexes radially outward"); §6 (Alternative B "deflected outward") | Enablement is tied to C6 (Q2) |
| C14 | Superelastic alloy ring element | N4 | Advantageous | §2 credits it with the "fast and stiff" recovery that makes the wipe work. §6 shows PEEK is an option with a weaker wipe | Technical effect: the wipe is degraded, not lost (§6) |
| C15 | NiTi, nominally 55.8 wt% Ni | N4 / N7 | Exemplary | §5. No tolerance and no other alloys are stated (01 Q14) | None beyond C14 |
| C16 | Af below 5 °C | N4 | Advantageous; essential **if** a shape-memory alloy is used (A5) | §4 ("superelastic at all riding temperatures"). §9 (item 2) raises the CO₂ cold-shock doubt (Q10) | **Technical effect**: a martensitic ring would not recover, so the purge gap would stay open or the wipe would be lost |
| C17 | Two-rate return spring (50) | N5 | Advantageous, provisional (A3) | §3(5). The disclosure does not say whether it is the only threshold arrangement (01 Q6, Q7) | None if another threshold arrangement is disclosed. Otherwise **enablement** of C3 |
| C18 | Over-travel threshold above the crack pressure and reachable by the inflation device | N0 (relationship) / N6 (values) | Relationship essential; values advantageous | §2 ("which every floor pump reaches"); §4. The basis for "every" is unstated (01 Q5) | **Technical effect**: a threshold that the pump cannot reach gives no purge (Q9) |
| C19 | Pressure ranges: crack pressure 0.8–1.5 bar; over-travel threshold 2.5–5.0 bar | N6 | Advantageous (believed, not evidenced) | §4. Only the prototype values were built (01 (h)) | None (Q13) |
| C20 | Over-travel 0.4–0.9 mm; purge gap 0.10–0.25 mm radial | N6 | Advantageous (believed) | §4. Neither was measured in the test (bench data) | None (Q13) |
| C21 | Ring element dimensions: inner diameter 2.0–2.6 mm, wall 0.15–0.30 mm, free length 2.5–4.0 mm, convolution amplitude 0.08–0.20 mm | N6 | Advantageous (believed); a "thin" wall is part of the concept | §2 ("thin, sinuous wall"); §4 | Enablement: at least one working set of dimensions must be disclosed, and the prototype values provide it |
| C22 | What limits over-travel (stop, coil-bind of the spring, or the ring) | Not placed | Unknown | Not stated (01 Q36) | Enablement is possible if the ring itself is the stop (fatigue) |
| C23 | Ring retained by about 0.03 mm interference against an internal shoulder | N7 | Exemplary, provisional | §7. Other retention methods are unstated (01 Q17). **Interacts with C6** | **Enablement**, through the purge-gap inconsistency (Q2) |
| C24 | Laser cut, shape-set at 500 °C for 10 minutes, water quench | N7 | Exemplary | §7 | Enablement: for a NiTi ring, some shape-setting route must be disclosed, and this one suffices |
| C25 | Electropolished ring surface | N7 | Exemplary (its function is unstated) | §5, §7 | None known (Q15) |
| C26 | Core body (20): threaded to the stem, carries the ring element, guides the poppet; brass CW614N or stainless 303 | N0 (carrier) / N7 (material) | Carrier conventional; material exemplary | §3(2), §5 | None |
| C27 | Poppet material: brass, or an anodised aluminium face | N7 | Exemplary | §5 | None |
| C28 | Spring material | N7 | Exemplary | §5 ("nothing in the concept depends on the spring material") | None |
| C29 | Presta-pattern valve stem (10), 6 mm | N7 | Conventional | §3(1). Whether the core alone is a product is open (01 Q33) | None (Q14) |
| C30 | Lock nut (70) | N7 | Conventional | §3(7) | None |
| C31 | Field of use: a tyre (inner tube or tubeless) holding liquid sealant | Context | Conventional context (A5) | §1. Only inner tubes were tested (§8) | Technical effect: the effect is defined against sealant |
| C32 | Thermal two-way shape-memory purge (Af about 35–40 °C) | Outside N0 | Exemplary, separate candidate concept | §6 (inventor doubtful; no data) | Not applicable (Q12) |

**Features whose omission may undermine enablement or technical effect:**
- **Enablement:**
  - C6/C7: the purge gap and air path are inconsistent (§2 against §3(6) and §7);
  - C12: the convolution is the only disclosed means of axial-to-radial conversion;
  - C17: the two-rate spring is the only disclosed threshold arrangement;
  - C23: the interference fit interacts with the purge-gap mechanism.
- **Technical effect:**
  - C2–C8: the nucleus;
  - C16: Af, where NiTi is used;
  - C18: the threshold must be reachable.

The most urgent Gate 1 items are Q1 and Q2 (01 Q1, Q2 and Q24). Without them the nucleus cannot be stated as enabled, and it cannot be fixed as purge-based, wipe-based or both.

## Rationale

**Why N0 is built from §2 and §6.** The nucleus is the intersection of the §2 concept with the inventor's own considered alternatives in §6, rather than a description of the prototype. §6 is the inventor's own statement that NiTi is not essential (Alternative A) and that sealing and purging can be split between separate parts (Alternative B). Using §6 as the boundary gives the broadest N0 the inventor's conception supports, without adding matter. I did not widen the ring element to elastomers: the inventor disparages rubber for the wipe (§2), and nothing suggests an elastomer ring element was conceived. That is asked as Q6, not included.

**Why the air purge is essential and the wipe advantageous.** The bench test does not separate the two actions. I made the air purge essential (provisionally) and the snap-back wipe advantageous for three reasons:
- §2 builds the concept around the purge gap.
- The film found in the purge-gap region shows that air flows there.
- The inventor accepts a weaker wipe in Alternative A for a product line.

The contrary reading is stated in full next to the ladder so that Gate 1 can reverse it cheaply.

**Rung order.** The ladder order keeps each of the inventor's alternatives in scope for as many rungs as the disclosure allows:
- The wipe (N1) comes before the one-piece seat (N2), because both A and the prototype wipe.
- The seat comes before the convolution (N3), because Alternative B's wiper-ring form is unknown.
- The convolution comes before the alloy (N4), because Alternative A shares the convolution.
- The two-rate spring comes late (N5), because §3(5) presents it as the means, not as the concept.

**Missing input.** Prompt 02 (commercial value map) was not available, so the rung order is not weighted by commercial value. Claims Architect should reconcile the two once 02 exists.

**Thermal variant.** This is kept off the ladder because it removes over-travel, which is the one feature common to everything else.

## Assumptions

A1. The ring element genus covers the NiTi seat ring (30), a PEEK ring of the same form (§6 Alternative A) and a stainless spring wiper ring (§6 Alternative B). This rests on §6 describing them as considered alternatives. The inventor has not confirmed they fall within the invention (01 Q20). **Blocking** for P3 and P5 until Q5.

A2. The air purge (C6, C7) is treated as essential and the snap-back wipe (C9) as advantageous. This rests on §2 (the purge gap as the core of the concept), §6 (a weaker wipe accepted in Alternative A) and the bench data (film in the purge-gap region). The test does not separate the two actions. **Blocking** for P3 and P5 until Q1.

A3. Some threshold arrangement distinguishing the normal stroke from over-travel is treated as essential, and the two-rate return spring as one species of it. This rests on §2 ("above a threshold") and §3(5). **Blocking** for P5 until Q3.

A4. The convoluted wall and radially outward deflection are treated as advantageous rather than essential. This rests on §3(3) presenting the convolution as the means of radial expansion, and on §6 Alternative B's wiper ring being "deflected outward" with no stated form. Not blocking for P3; **blocking** for P5 until Q4.

A5. Two contextual assumptions:
- Af below 5 °C is classified as essential only for a shape-memory-alloy ring element. This rests on §4 and §9 (item 2).
- Sealant use is treated as the field of use rather than as a structural feature of the combination (§1).

Not blocking.

A6. 01's assumptions A3–A5 carry forward unchanged: the pressure differential is pump side minus tube side; "upper" is the pump side; the poppet opens towards the tube. **Blocking** for P4, as in 01.

A7. Prompt 02 was not available, so the ladder is ordered by fallback logic and not by commercial value. Not blocking.

## Open Questions

Q1. Is the air purge alone, the snap-back wipe alone, or both needed to keep the valve sealing and opening over many sealant-loaded cycles (01 Q24)? The answer decides whether the nucleus is N0, the wipe-based reading or N1. Blocks P3, P5.

Q2. Where is the purge gap (60), how does it open when the ring is interference-fitted and flexes outward, and what is the full air path from the pump side into the tyre (01 Q1, Q2)? The nucleus is not enabled without this. Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q3. Must the over-travel threshold be distinct from the crack pressure? Would a poppet that deflects the ring element on every opening still work? Is the two-rate spring the only threshold arrangement conceived (01 Q6)? Blocks P3, P5.

Q4. Is the convoluted wall essential, or has the inventor conceived any other geometry that turns axial load from the purge shoulder into radial deflection (01 Q12)? Blocks P3, P5.

Q5. Does the inventor regard the PEEK ring (Alternative A) and the brass seat with a stainless wiper ring (Alternative B) as within the invention, so that the ring element need not be NiTi or a one-piece seat (01 Q20)? Blocks P3, P5.

Q6. Has the inventor conceived any other resilient material for the ring element, such as other polymers, spring metals or elastomers? §2 contrasts rubber unfavourably for the wipe only. Blocks P3.

Q7. In Alternative B, does the wiper ring wipe the poppet face on recovery, and if so which surface does it wipe (01 Q10)? Blocks P3, P4.

Q8. Must the purge shoulder (44) be a separate surface below the sealing face (42), or could another part of the poppet bear on the ring element during over-travel? Blocks P3, P5.

Q9. Which inflation devices must reach the over-travel threshold (floor pump, hand pump, CO₂ inflator, compressor), and what upper limit on the threshold follows (01 Q4, Q5)? Blocks P3, P5.

Q10. Is Af below 5 °C a requirement for the effect, and is there a lower bound or a margin needed for CO₂ inflation (01 Q13, Q28)? Blocks P3, P4.

Q11. At rest, must the closed purge gap be airtight? That is, is recovery essential to sealing, or only to cleaning (01 Q31)? Blocks P4, P5.

Q12. Should the thermal two-way variant be kept as a separate candidate concept or dropped (01 Q21)? Blocks P3, P5.

Q13. What is the basis for each §4 range beyond the prototype value (01 Q15)? Blocks P3, P4, P5.

Q14. Is the core without the valve stem (10) a product in its own right, and are other valve types conceived (01 Q26, Q33)? The answer decides whether the stem belongs in the nucleus context. Blocks P3, P5.

Q15. Does the electropolished surface do anything functionally, for example for the wipe, for sealant release or for fatigue life (01 Q32)? Blocks P4.

#### Reasons for the terms to avoid

- `bicycle valve`, `Presta valve`, `tube valve`, `Presta stem`: tie the invention to one vehicle, one valve standard or inner tubes only. Tubeless use is disclosed (§1); other valve types are open (01 Q26).
- `brass stem`, `brass core`, `brass seat`: material limitations. Stainless 303 is disclosed for the core body (§5).
- `valve insert`, `removable insert`: the removable insert is one of the existing remedies the inventor distinguishes (§1). `cartridge` collides with the CO2 cartridge inflator (§9).
- `NiTi ring`, `nitinol seat`, `nitinol`, `memory metal`: material-limit the seat ring although Alternative A (PEEK) is disclosed (§6); the last two are informal and imprecise.
- `shape-memory seat`, `memory effect`: imply thermally triggered shape memory. The seat ring works by superelastic recovery (§2, §4); the thermal route is a separate variant (§6).
- `grommet`, `O-ring`, `gasket`, `washer`: imply an elastomeric or flat sealing element, which is what the seat ring replaces (§2).
- `ring spring`, `snap ring`: names of known standard parts (friction ring spring, circlip) that would import their structure.
- `bellows`, `corrugated tube`, `pleated wall`: imply many convolutions and axial compliance; the disclosure has one or two convolutions that convert axial load into radial deflection (§3(3)).
- `upper edge`, `upper side`, `lower side`, `underside`: depend on orientation, which changes as the wheel turns and is not confirmed (01 Q3).
- `seat lip`: implies an elastomeric lip seal.
- `plunger`, `valve pin`, `needle`: imply a solid pin or needle-valve closure member.
- `valve cone`: fixes the geometry of the sealing face.
- `cam`, `wedge`: fix the profile of the purge shoulder (01 Q8).
- `coil spring`: fixes spring form. `two-rate spring` as a component name ties the over-travel threshold to the spring; whether other means can set it is open (01 Q6).
- `soft spring`, `stiff spring`: relative terms, and imply two separate springs.
- `bypass`, `bypass channel`: evoke the known bypass-valve category. `vent`: implies discharge to atmosphere; the purge flows into the inflatable chamber. `leak path`: implies a defect.
- `pump pressure`, `floor-pump pressure`: ambiguous between absolute and differential pressure, and tie the threshold to one pump type (01 Q5).
- `full stroke`: implies the end of poppet travel, which conflicts with over-travel beyond it.
- `overshoot`: implies an uncontrolled transient; over-travel is a pressure-set displacement (subject to 01 Q4).
- `buckling`, `collapse`: imply instability or failure; the radial deflection is elastic and recovered.
- `creep recovery`: §2 contrasts superelastic recovery with elastomer creep.
- `self-cleaning`, `anti-clogging`, `clog-proof`: overstate the effect. Film remained on the ring outer surface after 40 cycles (§8); a promissory result invites a clarity or utility objection.
- `air blast`: implies a discrete high-velocity event.
- `scraping`: implies a rigid scraper. `snap-through`, `snap-action`: denote bistable mechanisms the disclosure does not describe.
- `latex film`, `latex sealant`, `crust`: limit to latex chemistry, although ammonia-free sealants are in issue (§9); `crust` is informal.
- `pump stroke`: a different unit from the inflation event (01 A8).
- `transition temperature`: ambiguous (for PEEK it suggests glass transition); name the specific transformation temperature.
- `annealing`: a different heat treatment from shape-setting.
- `heat-activated valve`: evokes thermal valves generally.
- `scraper ring`: implies a rigid scraper; Alternative B describes a spring wiper deflected outward (§6).
- `slow leak`: informal; use leak-down with a stated threshold.

#### Terms that need an express definition in the specification

- **valve core**: which parts it comprises and whether it is claimed alone as a replacement part (Q10).
- **seat ring** and **deflectable ring element**: the functional definition (seats, deflects radially during over-travel, recovers), so that material and wall form are not implied; and whether the genus covers the Alternative B wiper ring (Q11).
- **convoluted wall**, **convolution amplitude**, **seat ring wall thickness**, **seat ring free length**: how each is measured (Q2, Q3).
- **purge gap**, **purge flow path**, **radial deflection**, **purge gap opening**: which surfaces bound the gap, the direction of deflection and how the opening is measured. Cannot be finalised until 01 Q1–Q2 are answered (Q1, Q4).
- **purge shoulder**: defined by its function, contact with the seat ring only during over-travel (§3(4)).
- **supply side**, **chamber side**: replace orientation words (Q13; 01 Q3).
- **pressure differential**, **crack pressure**, **over-travel threshold**: how the differential is taken and whether static or transient (Q13; 01 Q4).
- **normal stroke**, **over-travel**, **over-travel distance**: where the normal stroke ends and over-travel begins (Q6).
- **second spring stage**: defined by function (sets the over-travel threshold) so that the threshold is not tied to one spring construction (01 Q6).
- **air purge**: whether "air" means any inflation gas (Q8).
- **snap-back wipe**: which surface moves across which (Q5; 01 Q10).
- **sealant film**, **liquid sealant**: not limited to latex; cured and partially cured states.
- **inflatable chamber**: covers inner tubes and tubeless set-ups (Q9).
- **superelastic alloy**, **austenite finish temperature**, **martensite start temperature**: the property and measurement method (Q7).
- **closed state**, **purge state**: whether the closed purge gap must itself be airtight (01 Q31).
- **thermally actuated purge**, **wiper ring**: only if the inventor keeps these alternatives (01 Q20, Q21).
- **blockage**, **leak-down**, **inflation time**, **inflation cycle**, **inflation event**, **conventional valve core**: the test definitions for the worked example (§8, bench data).

#### Drafting notes on the table

- Bare words that collide with locked terms are not locked on their own and must not be used as component names: "tube" (inner tube, NiTi tube stock, tubeless), "stem" (valve stem, poppet stem), "seat" (seat ring, fixed seat), "spring", "shoulder", "core", "film". Always use the full preferred term.
- The core body bore and the stem bore are different features. The "valve core bore" of §1 is not mapped to either until 01 Q1 is answered.
- The inventor's relative words "thin", "light", "shallow", "fast", "stiff" and "slow" (§2, §3, §6) should be replaced in claims by the §4 values or by a relation between parts. Under EPO practice such relative terms draw clarity objections; in the US and UK they need an objective standard in the description.
- Several genus terms (deflectable ring element, biasing member, threshold-setting arrangement) pair a generic noun with a function. In the US that pattern can be read as means-plus-function under 35 U.S.C. §112(f) and limited to the disclosed structures and their equivalents. The Description should therefore describe each corresponding structure. EPO and UK practice does not apply this construction.
- Reference numerals follow §3: valve stem (10), core body (20), seat ring (30), poppet (40), sealing face (42), purge shoulder (44), return spring (50), purge gap (60), lock nut (70).

### Commercial Value Map

This is a drafting and analysis aid prepared by AI. It is not legal advice and makes no statement about patentability; qualified patent counsel signs off before anything is filed.

Ranking basis: which subject matter a competitor would have to practise to sell a comparable product or capture the same effect, read from `01` (Structured Invention Disclosure), the raw disclosure and the bench-test data. Component names and reference numerals are those locked in `01`.

| Rank | Subject matter | Who would practise it | Why it matters commercially | Recommended protection |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Valve core assembly** — core body (20) + seat ring (30) + poppet (40, with sealing face (42) and purge shoulder (44)) + threshold-setting return spring (50) (+ optional lock nut (70)) — drafted so the claim does **not** require the valve stem (10) as an element | Any manufacturer or aftermarket brand selling a compatible replacement valve core | This is the sellable, swappable unit itself. §1 records that conventional cores are already "sold in multipacks" for replacement after fouling, and the bench data quantifies exactly the advantage a buyer is paying for: conventional cores failed at cycle 12–18 (leak or block), while all three prototypes ran the full 40-cycle test with inflation time rising only 8–14% and leak-down staying at 0.1–0.2 bar/24 h. That measured durability gap is the product's whole commercial pitch, and the retrofit channel exists independently of any OEM stem sale. Claiming the core without the stem as a required element catches a competitor who sells only a compatible core (the far more likely infringer than one who also makes a matching stem) | **Independent claim** |
| 2 | **Resiliently deflectable seat/purge ring** (30) — the ring element whose wall geometry converts axial over-travel load into radial expansion, opens the purge gap (60), and elastically recovers to produce the snap-back wipe | Any component supplier selling a compatible ring or insert to third-party core assemblers, or a core maker sourcing the ring separately | This is the narrowest and most defensible point of novelty — no version of the self-purge effect exists without some form of this element, and the bench data's post-test inspection (clean sealing edge and clean poppet face at cycle 40, film only on the ring's outer surface) shows the ring is where the measured effect actually resides. A component-level claim catches suppliers who never sell a complete core, and anchors the dependent ladder for material and geometry species | **Independent claim** (component), with dependents for NiTi species, convolution form, and the broader genus at rank 5 |
| 3 | **Complete valve stem (10) + core, or a tube/tyre/wheel assembly incorporating it** | Tube and tyre manufacturers, complete-wheel and complete-bicycle OEMs | A separate, high-volume channel from the aftermarket core (rank 1): every new tube, tubeless tyre or wheel sold with the valve pre-fitted. Catches an OEM who integrates the valve without ever selling the core as a spare part | **Separate claim family** (system claim reciting the tube/tyre/wheel with the valve core of the independent apparatus claim) |
| 4 | **Method of manufacturing the seat ring** — laser-cutting the convoluted profile from NiTi tube stock on a mandrel, shape-setting in a fixture holding the wave geometry, water-quenching, electropolishing, and press-fitting into the core body with a controlled interference | A component manufacturer producing the ring at volume; likely a specialised NiTi subcontractor given the process described in §7 | Even if a competitor designs around the apparatus claims with a different ring geometry, a process claim can still catch anyone using this manufacturing route, and is a useful fallback where the finished ring geometry is hard to reverse-engineer or is made abroad | **Separate claim family** (process claims) |
| 5 | **Genus of resiliently deflectable ring material** (not limited to NiTi) — covers Alternative A, a PEEK ring with the same convoluted wall, proposed by the inventor for a lower-cost line | A competitor building a cheaper, non-metallic version of the same ring geometry — exactly the route the inventor itself has already identified | This is the inventor's own named design-around (§6, Alternative A). Claiming NiTi specifically and nothing broader hands a competitor an easy non-infringing substitute for a budget product | **Dependent claim** broadening the rank-2 ring claim to a material genus, with NiTi as a preferred dependent species |
| 6 | **Split sealing/purge architecture** — a rigid sealing seat plus a separate, thin resiliently deflectable wiper ring below it, deflected outward by the purge shoulder (Alternative B) | A competitor who separates the sealing and purge/wipe functions into two parts specifically to avoid a single-ring claim | Also the inventor's own named design-around (§6, Alternative B). A claim requiring one ring that both seals and wipes would not reach this two-part structure | **Dependent claim / separate claim family** reciting a sealing member and a separate resiliently deflectable wiping member as an alternative structure |
| 7 | **Threshold-setting mechanism** — currently embodied as the two-rate return spring (50), but claimed as any arrangement requiring a higher pressure differential to reach over-travel than to reach normal opening | Any core manufacturer, since some threshold behaviour is necessary to make the purge event a distinct, higher-pressure action rather than something that happens on every normal inflation | `01`'s Q6 leaves open whether the two-rate spring is the only way to set the threshold — the ring's own stiffness may contribute. Claiming the independent apparatus around "a two-rate spring" specifically would let a competitor substitute a different threshold means for a literal design-around | **Dependent claim** (independent claim should use functional language for the threshold, per `01`'s open question on essentiality) |
| 8 | **Self-purging method of operation** — moving the poppet through its normal stroke and into over-travel so the purge shoulder deflects the ring and opens the purge gap for air purge, then removing the pump head to allow recovery and snap-back wipe | Technically, every rider using the valve, and any competitor's valve exhibiting the same operating sequence | A freestanding method claim is commercially weak here: the event is internal, momentary (confirmed in the bench data only indirectly, by an audible snap on pump-head removal) and hidden inside the valve during ordinary pump use, so infringement by a rider is essentially undetectable and undesirable to assert. Its value is as a fallback against a competitor's differently-built valve that performs the same steps | **Dependent claim** on the apparatus (claimed as the apparatus "configured to" perform the steps), not a standalone method claim asserted against end users — flagged to Claims Architect (P5) for a final call on detectability |
| 9 | **Corrosion-resistant body variant** — stainless steel 303 core body/stem, machined and mentioned by the inventor for compatibility with ammonia-bearing sealant | A premium product line, or markets/sealant chemistries where brass corrosion is a known issue | Real but modest differentiator; the inventor has already machined this variant (though the bench data lists brass-body prototypes only, so it was not run through the durability test), so it is cheap to claim, but it protects a product line rather than the core inventive effect | **Dependent claim** |
| 10 | **Thermal two-way shape-memory manual-purge variant** (Af about 35–40 °C, warmed by hand to open the purge gap without a pump) | No current practitioner; a possible future pump-free-purge product | The inventor is explicitly unsure this is worth pursuing and has no data on it (§6). Ranking it for completeness only | **Not recommended for the main claim set now**; candidate for a dependent claim or a later continuation if the inventor confirms intent and supplies data |

No separate **consumable** was identified: the sealant itself is a third-party product used with the valve, not part of the invention, and is not addressed here.

## Rationale

I ranked by what a competitor must copy to obtain the same commercial outcome, in the order the AGENTS.md standing instruction asks for, not by inventive cleverness — the two-rate spring (rank 7) is a good example of something structurally necessary but commercially secondary to the ring itself. The most consequential judgement call is splitting rank 1 (core sold independently of the stem) from rank 3 (the same core integrated by an OEM into a tube, tyre or wheel): §1 describes an existing replacement-core market ("cores are sold in multipacks"), and drafting the primary independent claim so the stem is not a required element is what lets that claim reach a competitor who only ever sells a core. This is a claim-strategy consequence of the commercial analysis, not a technical fact, so I flagged it in Assumptions rather than asserting it as inventor-confirmed business intent.

With `intake/data/bench-test.md` now in the dossier, I strengthened ranks 1 and 2 with the actual per-core figures (cycles to failure, inflation-time drift, leak-down) rather than only the disclosure's summary statement, since a ranked commercial map is more useful to the drafters with the quantified advantage attached to the component that carries it. I did not use the bench data to change the ranking order itself — the durability data corroborates rank 1 and 2's position rather than establishing it, since the underlying commercial logic (an existing replacement-part market, and the ring being the narrowest point of novelty) already placed them there from the disclosure alone.

Ranks 5 and 6 track the inventor's own §6 alternatives directly, because a design-around the inventor has already named is the clearest evidence of where competitors will go; the disclosure_requests carried forward from `01` (support for Alternatives A and B) apply equally here — this map ranks them for commercial importance but does not assert they are supported for claiming yet. I ranked the method claim (rank 8) low relative to its structural counterpart because method claims requiring proof of a rider's internal, momentary valve action are a recognised enforcement weakness, and the bench data itself only detects that action indirectly (an audible snap), which reinforces the detectability concern rather than resolving it. I left the thermal variant (rank 10) at the bottom and recommended against building the main claim set around it, mirroring the inventor's own stated doubt (§6) and the absence of any data.

I did not invent a licensing, OEM-supply or consumer-retail business model beyond what §1's "sold in multipacks" already implies about the existing product category this invention competes in; where the map's ranking depends on a channel the disclosure does not confirm (standalone core sale vs OEM integration vs component licensing), I marked it as an assumption or open question rather than a stated fact.

## Assumptions

A1. A retrofit/replacement-core aftermarket channel exists for this invention, analogous to the conventional valve-core market described in §1 ("cores are sold in multipacks"). This underlies the rank-1 recommendation to claim the core independent of the stem. *Inferred from §1's description of existing industry practice, not a stated business model.* Not blocking, but ties to `01` Q33 (is the core intended to be sold alone).

A2. OEM/bulk supply to tube, tyre and wheel manufacturers is a plausible separate channel (rank 3), given the tube and tubeless use cases in §1 and §6. *Market-based inference.* Not blocking.

A3. A freestanding method-of-operation claim (rank 8) asserted against end users is commercially weak because the operating event is internal, momentary and not readily observable during ordinary use — the bench data's own reliance on an audible snap as the only indicator supports this reading but does not itself establish it as a commercial/legal conclusion. *Legal/commercial judgement, not drawn from the disclosure.* Not blocking; feeds the recommendation at rank 8, flagged to P5 for a final call.

A4. No consumable distinct from the (third-party) sealant was identified in the disclosure, so no consumable row is included in the map. Not blocking.

A5. Component-level licensing of the ring (rank 2) and the manufacturing process (rank 4) to third-party core or valve manufacturers is a plausible channel, given the specialised NiTi processing in §7. *Inferred, not stated.* Not blocking.

## Open Questions

Q1. Does the inventor intend to sell the valve core assembly as a standalone replacement product (as with conventional cores), supply or license the ring and/or manufacturing process to other core or valve manufacturers, supply complete valves to tube/tyre/wheel OEMs, or some combination? This determines which of ranks 1, 2, 3 and 4 should receive the primary independent claim and which should be secondary claim families. Related to `01` Q33. Blocks P5.

Q2. Does the inventor regard Alternative B's split sealing/purge architecture (rank 6) as commercially worth pursuing as its own product line, or only as a design-around blocker to be claimed but not built? This affects how much specification detail (P4) is worth investing in that variant beyond what closes the design-around. Blocks P4, P5.

Q3. Is there any intended consumable, kit or subscription-style product (e.g. a purge-verified sealant sold alongside the valve, or a spare-ring refill pack) that the disclosure does not mention? If none, the map's "no consumable identified" conclusion stands. Blocks P2 (confidence of this map only; not otherwise blocking).

## Files to write

Write each of these with your Write tool, at exactly this path, one file per call (the folders exist). Write nothing outside the run folder `{R}`. Do not run the checks yourself: the runner runs them and will tell you if anything fails.

- `/Users/ahmed/PatentCouncil/matters/valve-oc-20260930/runs/r1/P3/12.md`

When every file is written, reply with one line per file (path and a few words on what it holds) and anything the runner must route: open questions, disclosure requests, open disagreements, narrowing suggested. Nothing else.
