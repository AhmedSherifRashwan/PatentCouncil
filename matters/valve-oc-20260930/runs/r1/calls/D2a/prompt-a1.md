You are the **Litigator**. Follow your AGENTS.md. This message is the whole brief: what to do, the prompts to execute, every input (embedded below, so do not re-read those files), and the exact files to write.

## What to do

As a well-funded competitor, find the cheapest credible escape from each confirmed embodiment. Write `debate/d2-attack.md`: each escape route names the embodiment it avoids and why it works commercially. The drafters must close these routes in the description and the claims.

**Time budget:** about 8 minutes. The whole matter is planned to finish end to end in two hours. Be complete, but write each deliverable once: no drafts, no repetition, no padding.

### Design-Around Risk Register

**Status: candidate.** Nothing below is specification content until the human confirms it at Gate 2. None of the alternatives has been built or tested; the only built embodiment is the prototype of §3–§8. This register was prepared by AI as a drafting and analysis aid. It is not legal advice, and qualified patent counsel signs off before anything is filed.

**Sources and references.** The proposed claim limitations are the nucleus N0(a)–(e), the ladder rungs N1–N7 and the feature codes C1–C32 of `03`, together with the claim-type ranks of `02`. `09` and `10` do not exist yet, so no "possible claim language" column was available (A1). `intake/disclosure.md` is cited as §1–§9. The "Support" column reads either **Dossier** (the alternative is disclosed in some form, with the passage cited) or **Needs inventor confirmation**, with the open question below that Gate 2 must answer. Three rows are marked **Cannot be closed without new matter**: they become inventor questions, not embodiments. Rows are ranked by risk, highest first. Risk combines three things: technical plausibility, commercial attractiveness, and whether the route escapes the nucleus N0 or only a ladder rung.

| ID | Design-around (what the competitor builds) | Limitation avoided | Technical plausibility | Commercial attractiveness | Broader genus or alternative embodiment the specification could describe | Support | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DA-1 | **Purge on every opening.** A single-rate return spring is used, and the poppet's deflecting surface reaches the seat ring at or just after the crack pressure. The purge gap then opens on every opening and there is no separate over-travel threshold. | N0(b): the threshold-setting arrangement, and over-travel beyond the normal stroke (C2, C3). N0(c): "only during over-travel" (C4). | **Medium.** Mechanically simpler. Unknown whether leak-down and seat-ring fatigue hold if the ring deflects on every opening, possibly on every piston cycle of a floor pump (01 Q4, Q27). | **High.** Removes the second spring stage and the threshold tuning. | Describe an over-travel threshold that may equal or barely exceed the crack pressure, including an embodiment with a negligible normal stroke in which the purge state is reached on every opening. Define the purge state by deflection of the deflectable ring element, not by a second threshold. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q1; 03 Q3) | candidate |
| DA-2 | **Deflection in another direction.** The deflectable ring element is deflected radially inward, tilted, or lifted axially off the internal shoulder. The purge gap then forms at its inner surface, at an end face or against the poppet, not between its outer surface and the core body bore. | N0(d): the purge gap as locked (an annular radial clearance between the seat ring outer surface and the core body bore, §3(6)). C13: radially outward radial deflection. | **High.** Each is an ordinary elastic deformation of a thin-walled ring. The base embodiment's own direction is unresolved (01 Q1, Q2), so a competitor can pick whichever reading the claims leave out. | **High.** No cost penalty. A competitor can copy the prototype and argue that the gap is elsewhere. | Define the purge gap by function: any clearance bounded partly by the deflectable ring element, closed in the closed state and opened by the deflection. Describe outward, inward, axial and tilting deflection, with the gap at the outer surface, the inner surface or an end face. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q2; 01 Q1, Q2). The base embodiment must be resolved first. | candidate |
| DA-3 | **Slotted or segmented purge opening.** The seat ring wall carries laser-cut slits or apertures that are closed at rest and open when the purge shoulder strains the wall. Alternatively, the ring is split into fingers whose gaps open. Air flows through the wall, not around it. | N0(d): the "annular" purge gap. The implied continuity of the seat ring (C5, C6). | **High.** The prototype is already laser-cut (§7), and strain-opened slits in a thin wall are an ordinary structure. Whether closed slits seal at rest needs inventor comment (01 Q31). | **High.** Same tooling. The ring can be press-fitted with no clearance at its outer surface. | Describe a purge opening genus: an annular gap, one or more slits or apertures in the wall, or gaps between the fingers of a segmented ring element. Describe the deflectable ring element as continuous, split or segmented. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q3) | candidate |
| DA-4 | **No distinct purge shoulder.** One conical sealing face seals on the sealing edge at rest and, pushed further in over-travel, forces the sealing edge to deflect radially. Alternatively, a taper on the poppet stem entering the seat ring does the deflecting. | N0(c): the purge shoulder as a surface separate from the sealing face and on its chamber side (C4; the locked species of purge shoulder). | **Medium–high.** Depends on the poppet's direction of travel (01 Q3), but either a sealing face or a taper on the poppet stem can put a radial load on a thin ring. | **High.** One fewer turned feature and a simpler poppet. | Define the purge shoulder by function: the formation of the poppet that contacts the deflectable ring element during over-travel. State that it may be the sealing face, a continuation of it, a taper on the poppet stem, or a separate formation. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q4; 03 Q8) | candidate |
| DA-5 | **Integral lip.** The core body is injection-moulded polymer, or a spring-metal pressing, with an integral thin annular lip. The lip seals against the sealing face and is deflected during over-travel. There is no separate seat ring and no interference fit. | The seat ring as a separate part carried by the core body (C5, C26). N7: interference fit (C23). | **Medium–high.** Moulded lips are a known polymer feature. Recovery and the snap-back wipe would probably be weaker, as §6 says of PEEK. A brass lip is unlikely to recover. | **High.** Removes the NiTi part, laser cutting, shape-setting and press-fitting: a volume cost-down. | Describe the deflectable ring element as either separate from the core body or integral with it (moulded, machined or pressed). Describe a polymer core body as well as a metal one. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q5). PEEK as a ring material: Dossier §6. | candidate |
| DA-6 | **Different valve format.** The mechanism is built directly into the valve stem of an integrated tubeless inflation valve with no removable valve core. Alternatively, it is built into a Schrader-pattern or Dunlop-pattern valve core. | The valve core as a core body threaded into the stem bore (C26). Any Presta-pattern limitation (C29). | **High.** The mechanism does not depend on the thread or on the Presta pattern. | **High.** Reaches OEM tubeless valves (02 rank 3) and Schrader-pattern markets. | Describe the mechanism in any inflation valve, with its parts carried either by a removable core body or directly by the valve stem. Name the other valve standards as candidates and keep Presta-pattern as the worked example. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q6; 01 Q26, Q33; 03 Q14) | candidate |
| DA-7 | **Over-travel uncovers a port.** In over-travel the poppet uncovers a purge port in the core body bore (spool-type porting) that directs air across the sealing edge into the inflatable chamber. Nothing deflects and nothing recovers. | N0(c)–(e): the deflectable ring element, its deflection and its shape recovery (C5, C6, C8). | **Medium.** Porting by poppet travel is ordinary. Unevidenced whether directed air alone removes cured sealant film (01 Q24). | **High.** No special alloy and no ring. | Only a genus such as "a purge flow path opened by over-travel, whether by deflecting an element or by uncovering a port" would close this route. Nothing in the dossier suggests the inventor conceived porting. | **Cannot be closed without new matter** unless the inventor confirms conception (Q7) | candidate |
| DA-8 | **Kinematic inversion.** The deflectable ring element is a thin skirt carried by the poppet. In over-travel a fixed formation in the core body deflects it, and on recovery it wipes the core body bore. | N0(c): a purge shoulder on the poppet bearing on a ring element carried by the core body (C4, C5). | **Medium.** Mechanically symmetric, but the wipe then acts on the core body bore rather than the sealing face (01 Q10). | **Medium.** A moving ring adds mass and fatigue risk. | Describe the deflecting formation and the deflectable ring element as each carried by either the poppet or the core body, with the counterpart on the other. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q8) | candidate |
| DA-9 | **Mechanical over-travel.** An adaptor or actuator on the inflation device pushes the poppet into over-travel whatever the pressure differential, or the user pushes it by hand. The valve has only a single-rate return spring. | N0(b): over-travel caused by the pressure differential exceeding the over-travel threshold (C2, C18). | **High** mechanically. It depends on an adaptor or a user step. | **Medium.** An adaptor can be bundled with the valve. The adaptor maker, not the valve vendor, may then be the only party practising the full combination. | Describe over-travel produced by the pressure differential, by a poppet-depressing actuator on the inflation device or an adaptor, or by pressing the poppet by hand. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q9) | candidate |
| DA-10 | **Wipe only.** The deflectable ring element is sealed at its periphery, so no air flows through the purge gap. Over-travel and shape recovery produce only the snap-back wipe. | N0(d): the air purge (C6, C7). | **Medium.** Depends on whether the snap-back wipe alone keeps the valve sealing and opening. The bench test does not separate the two cleaning actions (01 Q24; 03 Q1). | **Medium.** Same parts, and it avoids a limitation requiring the air purge. | Describe the cleaning action as the air purge, the snap-back wipe, or both. Include a wipe-only embodiment and describe the snap-back wipe independently of any flow. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q10; 03 Q1, A2) | candidate |
| DA-11 | **Other threshold-setting arrangement.** Examples: two compression springs (a second one engaged at the end of the normal stroke); a magnetic or ball detent; an elastomer stop; or a single-rate return spring with the seat ring's own stiffness supplying the step. | N5: the two-stage return spring, i.e. the first spring stage plus the second spring stage (C17). | **High.** All are conventional ways to get a stepped force–stroke characteristic. | **Medium.** Escapes only N5, but a competitor tuning its own threshold will choose one of these. | Describe a threshold-setting arrangement genus with these species. State that the return spring and the deflectable ring element may each contribute. Keep the two-stage return spring as the example. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q11; 01 Q6, Q7) | candidate |
| DA-12 | **Straight-walled seat ring.** A tapered interface (a tapered purge shoulder, a chamfered sealing edge, or a conical inner surface of the seat ring) converts axial load into radial deflection without a convoluted wall. | N3: the convoluted wall (C12). | **Medium.** Works geometrically. Recoverable strain limits the purge gap opening, and the convolution may be there to keep strain low (01 Q12). | **Medium–high.** A simpler ring with no wave fixture. | Describe an axial-to-radial conversion geometry genus: a convoluted wall, a tapered or chamfered interface on either part, or a slotted wall. Keep the convoluted wall as the preferred species. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q12; 03 Q4) | candidate |
| DA-13 | **Polymer ring element:** PEEK as in §6, or another engineering polymer, moulded rather than cut. | N4: superelastic alloy (C14, C15) and the austenite finish temperature (C16). | **High.** The inventor proposes PEEK for a lower-cost line, accepting a weaker snap-back wipe (§6). | **High.** A budget line (02 rank 5). | Describe the deflectable ring element in polymer, with PEEK as the disclosed species. Add other polymers and moulding only if the inventor conceived them. | PEEK: Dossier §6. Other polymers and moulding: needs inventor confirmation (Q13; 03 Q6) | candidate |
| DA-14 | **Other resilient metal.** A spring metal that is not superelastic (stainless spring steel, beryllium copper), or another superelastic alloy (ternary NiTi, copper-based). | N4: superelastic alloy; nickel content (C15). | **Medium.** Conventional spring metals recover far less strain than superelastic alloys, so the wall geometry or the purge gap opening would change. §6 Alternative B already uses a stainless spring wiper ring. | **Medium.** Cheaper stock and no NiTi supply chain. | Describe the deflectable ring element in a resilient metal, superelastic or not, with NiTi as the preferred species. Stainless steel for the wiper ring is already disclosed. | Stainless wiper ring: Dossier §6. Other metals and alloys: needs inventor confirmation (Q14; 01 Q14) | candidate |
| DA-15 | **Elastomeric ring element**, for example a high-hardness thermoplastic elastomer. | N4, and any wording that defines the ring element by fast, stiff shape recovery (C9, C14). | **Low–medium.** The inventor states that latex would embed itself in rubber (§2). | **High.** The cheapest material. | An elastomer embodiment cannot be added unless the inventor conceived it. The specification can still avoid turning §2 into a disclaimer: present superelastic shape recovery as preferred, not as the definition of the deflectable ring element. | Drafting point: reading of §2. Elastomer embodiment: needs inventor confirmation (Q15; 03 Q6) | candidate |
| DA-16 | **Values outside the believed ranges.** For example: over-travel threshold below 2.5 bar or above 5.0 bar; seat ring wall thickness outside 0.15–0.30 mm; over-travel distance outside 0.4–0.9 mm. | N6: the ranges (C19–C21). | **High.** Nothing in the mechanism fixes these endpoints, and the inventor says they are believed, not evidenced (§4). | **Medium.** Tuning only. | Lead with the relationships that make the mechanism work: the over-travel threshold is above the crack pressure and within what the inflation device reaches, and the purge gap is closed at rest. Give the ranges as a ladder (Prompt 13), with no new endpoints without data. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q16; 01 Q15) | candidate |
| DA-17 | **Split sealing and purge** (§6 Alternative B). A fixed seat seals, and a separate wiper ring is deflected by the purge shoulder. | N2: the seat ring also forms the seat (C10). | **Medium–high.** The inventor proposes it, at the cost of one more part and more axial length (§6). | **Medium.** "Possibly easier to make" (§6). | Describe Alternative B as a species of the deflectable ring element used with a fixed seat. Include the wiper ring's form, thickness and retention, and whether it wipes the sealing face. | Existence: Dossier §6. Details: needs inventor confirmation (Q17; 01 Q20; 03 Q7) | candidate |
| DA-18 | **More or different convolutions.** Three or more convolutions, or another profile (circumferential rather than axial wave, helical, saw-tooth). | N3: "one or two" convolutions (C12). | **High.** An obvious variation once the convolution is known. | **Low–medium.** | Describe the convoluted wall as having at least one convolution of any profile, with one and two as the disclosed species. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q18; 01 Q11) | candidate |
| DA-19 | **Component or kit sale.** The seat ring, or the seat ring with the poppet and return spring, sold as a kit to fit into a core body the customer supplies. | Any claim that requires the assembled valve core including the core body (02 rank 1). | **Low–medium.** Conventional core bodies are not designed to be taken apart. | **Low–medium.** | Describe the seat ring and the poppet as separately supplied components, and describe the kit. Component claims are for Claims Architect (02 rank 2). | Needs inventor confirmation (Q19; 02 Q1; 01 Q33) | candidate |
| DA-20 | **Purge on deflation.** The user presses the poppet into over-travel while deflating, so chamber air leaves through the purge gap. Inflation uses the normal stroke only. | N0(d): inflation gas flowing through the purge gap into the inflatable chamber during an inflation event. | **Medium.** Over-travel by hand is plausible, but the outward flow carries liquid sealant towards the user. | **Low.** | Describe the purge state reached during deflation, with flow through the purge gap in either direction. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q20; 01 Q23) | candidate |
| DA-21 | **Different ring manufacture.** Pressing from strip and rolling; photo-chemical etching; drawing tube stock with a formed wave; machining from bar; or moulding (polymer). | The manufacturing method (02 rank 4): laser cutting, shape-setting in a fixture, water quench, electropolishing (C24, C25). | **High.** | **Medium.** These are volume routes. | Describe the alternative forming routes and process windows as candidates, keeping the §7 route as the example. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q21; 01 Q32) | candidate |
| DA-22 | **Other retention.** Adhesive, crimping, staking, laser welding, over-moulding, or clamping between two core body parts, with no interference fit. | N7: interference fit against the internal shoulder (C23). | **High.** | **Low.** | Describe a retention genus with the interference fit as the example. | Needs inventor confirmation (Q22; 01 Q17). Resolve the interaction with the purge gap (01 Q2) first. | candidate |
| DA-23 | **Rigid wiping edge.** A fixed edge in the core body over which the poppet slides during over-travel, shearing sealant film off the poppet. Nothing deflects. | N0(c)–(e): the deflectable ring element and its shape recovery (C5, C8). N1: the snap-back wipe (C9). | **Medium.** Sliding wipers are known, but cured sealant film may jam a rigid close fit. | **Medium.** | Cannot be closed from the dossier: the inventor's concept is the recovery of a deflected element. | **Cannot be closed without new matter** unless the inventor confirms conception (Q23) | candidate |
| DA-24 | **Ring deflected by pressure, without contact.** A thin polymer ring element is deflected by the pressure differential alone, opening the purge gap; the poppet never touches it. | N0(c): contact by the purge shoulder (C4). Over-travel (C2). | **Low for metal.** At the disclosed pressures the hoop load on a 0.20 mm NiTi wall gives negligible deflection. **Medium for a thin polymer ring.** | **Low–medium.** | Only a genus such as "deflected by the purge shoulder or by the pressure differential" would close this route, and it is not in the dossier. | **Cannot be closed without new matter** unless the inventor confirms conception (Q24) | candidate |
| DA-25 | **Thermally actuated purge** (§6). A two-way shape-memory ring element opens the purge gap when warmed; there is no over-travel. | N0(b)–(c): over-travel and the purge shoulder. | **Low.** The inventor doubts it and there is no data (§6). | **Low.** | Describe the thermally actuated purge as a separate candidate concept, and only if the inventor keeps it. | Concept only, no data: Dossier §6. Keep or drop: needs inventor confirmation (Q25; 01 Q21) | candidate |

**Findings for Claims Architect and Specification Drafter** (candidate; for Gate 2):

1. **DA-1 is the cheapest escape from N0.** If the inventor confirms that purging on every opening works (Q1), then the threshold-setting arrangement (C3) is not essential and should not appear in the broadest claim.
2. **The purge gap needs a functional definition (DA-2, DA-3).** The locked species, "annular radial clearance between the seat ring outer surface and the core body bore", can be avoided without cost. This holds even before 01 Q1/Q2 are answered, and those answers are needed before any of this can be enabled.
3. **Three more features should be described by function or as a genus:**
   - the purge shoulder (DA-4);
   - the deflectable ring element, as separate from or integral with the core body (DA-5);
   - the mechanism, as usable in any inflation valve (DA-6).
4. **Four ladder features are already shown to be non-essential by the inventor's own §6 alternatives or by ordinary engineering:**
   - the convoluted wall (DA-12, DA-18);
   - the superelastic alloy (DA-13, DA-14);
   - the one-piece seat (DA-17);
   - the two-stage return spring (DA-11).
5. **DA-7, DA-23 and DA-24 cannot be closed without matter the inventor has not conceived.** They are recorded as inventor questions only.
6. **Detectability.**
   - A teardown and section of a competitor's valve core shows the routes in DA-2 to DA-6 and DA-11 to DA-18.
   - DA-1, DA-9 and DA-10 turn on behaviour (when deflection occurs, and whether air flows through the purge gap), which needs a bench test on the product.

### Equivalent Architecture Library

**Status: candidate.** Every entry below is a candidate for Human Gate 2. Entries marked *disclosed* restate what the inventor's disclosure already contains. Every other entry comes from engineering analysis. None of them has been built or tested, and none of them may enter the Description until the inventor confirms at Gate 2 that it is technically real and within their conception. This library is a drafting and analysis aid prepared by AI. It is not legal advice, and qualified patent counsel signs off before anything is filed.

**Sources.** §1–§9 refer to `intake/disclosure.md`, read through `01`. `01 (x)` is the structured disclosure, `03 Cn` the feature classification, `02 rank n` the commercial value map, and LOCKED is `terminology/LOCKED.md`.

**Inputs not available.** `11`, `09`, `10` and `intake/answers.md` did not exist when this was written. That has three consequences:
- **No design-around cross-references.** Instead, each entry's "Changes" line names the escape route it would cover, so it can be re-mapped to `11` ids at Gate 2.
- **No weighting against the prior art.**
- **Every open question in `01` and `03` is treated as unanswered.** This matters most for the location of the purge gap (01 Q1, Q2).

**Coverage.** The library covers every feature that `03` classifies as essential or advantageous: C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C12, C13, C14, C16, C17, and the C18 relationship. It also covers four features classified conventional or exemplary, because each is a likely design-around route: the ring retention (C23), the seat ring manufacture (C24, C25), the sealing face (C11) and the valve core type (C29). The ranges (C19–C21) are left to Prompt 13 and are not laddered here.

| Section | Locked term | 03 feature |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | over-travel | C2, C18 |
| 2 | second spring stage (threshold-setting arrangement) | C3, C17 |
| 3 | purge shoulder | C4 |
| 4 | deflectable ring element | C5, C10 |
| 5 | convoluted wall | C12 |
| 6 | radial deflection | C13 |
| 7 | purge gap | C6 |
| 8 | purge flow path | C7 |
| 9 | shape recovery | C8 |
| 10 | snap-back wipe | C9 |
| 11 | sealing face | C10, C11 |
| 12 | superelastic alloy | C14, C15 |
| 13 | austenite finish temperature | C16 |
| 14 | interference fit | C23, C26 |
| 15 | shape-setting (seat ring manufacture) | C24, C25 |
| 16 | valve core | C29 |

**How to read an entry.** Each entry gives:
- **Structure:** the concrete structure or mechanism.
- **Same purpose:** how it achieves the same technical purpose.
- **Changes:** what changes (interfaces, ordering, materials), and the escape route the entry would cover.
- **Genus:** the term that would cover both the disclosed form and the alternative.
- **Credibility:** an engineering judgement, not test data.

"Basis" reads either *disclosed (§n)* or *not conceived in the dossier — inventor to confirm (Qn)*.

#### 1. over-travel

1. **E1.1 Axial over-travel of the poppet against the second spring stage.** *Disclosed (§2, §3(5)).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E1.2 Separate purge actuator.** *Not conceived — Q9.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: an annular piston or flexible diaphragm is housed in the core body, with its supply side open to supply-side pressure and its own compression spring as bias. It advances only when the pressure differential exceeds the over-travel threshold, and it carries the deflecting formation onto the seat ring. The poppet performs only its normal stroke.
   - Same purpose: the seat ring is deflected, and the purge gap opened, only above the over-travel threshold, while inflation gas is flowing.
   - Changes: purge actuation is decoupled from the poppet, and the poppet needs no purge shoulder. It adds a part and a sliding seal exposed to liquid sealant. Covers the route "the part that deflects the ring is not the poppet".
   - Genus: a member moved, above the over-travel threshold, beyond the position it occupies in the normal-open state, so as to deflect the deflectable ring element.
   - Credibility: mechanically sound. Space is tight in a 6 mm Presta-pattern valve stem, where the annulus around a seat ring of 2.3 mm inner diameter leaves little piston area. It is more plausible in larger-bore valve cores (see E16.2).
3. **E1.3 Two-part poppet with a purge sleeve.** *Not conceived — Q4.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: the sealing face is on the poppet. The purge shoulder is on a sleeve that slides on the poppet stem. The sleeve travels with the poppet during the normal stroke and is pushed onto the seat ring only in over-travel.
   - Same purpose: as E1.1.
   - Changes: the poppet is split into two parts. Covers the route "the purge shoulder is not part of the poppet".
   - Genus: a deflecting formation that moves with the poppet.
   - Credibility: credible. The sleeve clearance on the poppet stem is a new place for sealant film to form.
4. **E1.4 Over-travel produced mechanically by the inflation device.** *Not conceived — Q9.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a fixed depressor in the inflation-device head drives the poppet into over-travel on coupling, whatever the pressure differential.
   - Same purpose: the seat ring deflects and the purge gap opens while inflation gas flows, so the air purge runs.
   - Changes: the threshold is set by the geometry of the head, not by a pressure differential, and the purge lasts for the whole coupling. The valve core could omit the second spring stage altogether. Covers the route "a head plus a core with no pressure threshold".
   - Genus: over-travel produced by the pressure differential or by mechanical actuation.
   - Credibility: credible. Depressor heads exist for Schrader-pattern valves; for Presta-pattern valves this needs a matching head.
5. **E1.5 User-actuated over-travel.** *Not conceived — Q9.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: with the lock nut released, the user presses the poppet beyond its normal stroke with the chamber pressurised.
   - Same purpose: the seat ring deflects and the purge gap opens.
   - Changes: the purge flow runs from the chamber side to the supply side, carrying sealant film out of the valve rather than into the inflatable chamber. It needs user action. Covers the route "the purge is a user operation, not part of inflation".
   - Genus: over-travel produced by the pressure differential or by mechanical actuation.
   - Credibility: physically credible. It conflicts with the §2 statement of effect ("no tool and no rider action"), so it may lie outside the conception. The inventor must decide.

#### 2. second spring stage (threshold-setting arrangement)

1. **E2.1 Two-rate compression spring.** *Disclosed (§3(5)); construction unknown (01 Q6).* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: one candidate construction is a variable-pitch compression spring whose close-pitched section becomes solid at the end of the normal stroke, leaving fewer active turns and a higher rate.
   - Genus: threshold-setting arrangement.
   - Credibility: standard spring practice. That this is the prototype's construction is **not** asserted.
2. **E2.2 Auxiliary compression spring with lost motion.** *Not conceived — Q2.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: the return spring acts alone over the normal stroke as the first spring stage. A second compression spring is engaged only when a lost-motion clearance closes at the end of the normal stroke, and then acts in parallel.
   - Same purpose: the force rises in a step at the end of the normal stroke, so over-travel needs a higher pressure differential.
   - Changes: two parts instead of one, and each stage can be tuned independently. Covers the route "two springs, not a two-rate spring".
   - Genus: threshold-setting arrangement.
   - Credibility: high; common practice for springs.
3. **E2.3 Seat ring stiffness as the threshold.** *Not conceived; raised as a question in 01 Q6 — Q3.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a single-rate return spring. The over-travel threshold is set by the force the purge shoulder needs to deflect the deflectable ring element. In a superelastic alloy, the loading follows a stress plateau after the initial elastic rise, so the force–deflection curve behaves like a threshold.
   - Same purpose: the poppet stops at the end of its normal stroke until the pressure differential can overcome the ring's resistance.
   - Changes: one part fewer. The threshold is coupled to the ring's dimensions and to temperature, because the plateau stress of a superelastic alloy rises with temperature. A PEEK or spring-metal ring has no plateau, so its threshold is less distinct. Covers the route "no dedicated second spring stage".
   - Genus: threshold-setting arrangement.
   - Credibility: credible in principle. How much the ring contributes in the prototype is unknown.
4. **E2.4 Disc spring stack engaged after lost motion.** *Not conceived — Q2.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: one or more conical disc springs of stainless steel, stacked, are engaged when a lost-motion clearance closes.
   - Same purpose: as E2.2, with high force in a short axial length.
   - Changes: more axial compactness, at the cost of more parts. Covers the same route as E2.2.
   - Genus: threshold-setting arrangement.
   - Credibility: high as a spring. Stack friction adds hysteresis.
5. **E2.5 Detent.** *Not conceived — Q2.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: either a spring-loaded ball, or a radially sprung element, in the core body engages a circumferential groove on the poppet stem at the end of the normal stroke; or a permanent magnet in the core body attracts a ferritic stainless target on the poppet.
   - Same purpose: the poppet is held at the end of its normal stroke until the force exceeds a breakaway value.
   - Changes: the force falls after breakaway, so the poppet crosses over-travel quickly. The detent must release on the return. A brass poppet needs a ferritic target for the magnetic version. A sliding detent exposed to sealant is a failure mode for Prompt 15. Covers the route "no spring sets the threshold".
   - Genus: threshold-setting arrangement.
   - Credibility: moderate. The magnetic version avoids sliding contacts exposed to sealant.
6. **E2.6 Polymer compression bush as the second spring stage.** *Not conceived — Q2.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: an annular bush of engineering polymer is engaged after lost motion.
   - Same purpose: as E2.2.
   - Changes: the material. Covers the route "a non-metallic second spring stage".
   - Genus: threshold-setting arrangement.
   - Credibility: moderate. Compression set and swelling in ammonia-bearing sealant are the risks. The §2 criticism of rubber concerns the seat, not the threshold.

#### 3. purge shoulder

1. **E3.1 Annular shoulder integral with the poppet, on the chamber side of the sealing face.** *Disclosed (§3(4)); geometry unknown (01 Q8).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E3.2 Tapered purge shoulder.** *Not conceived — Q4.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a frustoconical flank on the poppet enters the seat ring during over-travel and deflects the seat ring radially outward by direct radial contact, in the way a mandrel expands a ring.
   - Same purpose: the seat ring is deflected only during over-travel.
   - Changes: the load on the ring is radial, not axial, so no axial-to-radial conversion geometry is needed (E5.5). The flank slides on the ring's inner surface: more friction and wear, but it also wipes that surface on the return. Covers the route "a straight-walled ring driven by a tapered poppet".
   - Genus: deflecting formation.
   - Credibility: high; this is a standard way of expanding a ring.
3. **E3.3 Discrete lugs.** *Not conceived — Q4.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: two to four radial lugs on the poppet in place of a continuous annulus.
   - Same purpose: the seat ring is deflected locally during over-travel.
   - Changes: the ring ovalises (E6.3), the purge gap opens over arcs rather than all round, and less force is needed. Covers the route "no annular shoulder".
   - Genus: a deflecting formation that contacts the deflectable ring element at one or more places around its circumference.
   - Credibility: credible. The purge flow is non-uniform.
4. **E3.4 Separate collar fixed on the poppet stem.** *Not conceived — Q4.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a collar, for example of stainless steel on a brass poppet, is pressed, crimped or threaded onto the poppet stem.
   - Same purpose: as E3.1.
   - Changes: an assembly step, and a free choice of material for wear against the ring. Covers the route "the purge shoulder is not integral".
   - Genus: deflecting formation.
   - Credibility: high.
5. **E3.5 Return-spring retainer as the deflecting formation.** *Not conceived — Q4.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: the retainer that seats the return spring on the poppet bears on the chamber-side end of the seat ring during over-travel.
   - Same purpose: as E3.1.
   - Changes: the contact moves to the other end of the ring, and one part does two jobs. Covers the route "the deflecting surface is a spring retainer, not a shoulder on the poppet".
   - Genus: deflecting formation.
   - Credibility: credible, if the stroke geometry allows it (01 Q8, Q36).

#### 4. deflectable ring element

1. **E4.1 One-piece seat ring that both seals and deflects.** *Disclosed (§3(3)): NiTi; PEEK in Alternative A (§6).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E4.2 Fixed seat plus wiper ring.** *Disclosed as Alternative B (§6); details unknown (01 Q20, 03 Q7).* Status: candidate (baseline).
3. **E4.3 Slotted seat ring.** *Not conceived — Q5.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a short tubular ring with a continuous band at the sealing-edge end, and axial slots cut from the other end that form fingers. The fingers splay radially under the purge shoulder.
   - Same purpose: large radial deflection at low force and low strain. The continuous band keeps the sealing edge intact.
   - Changes: the purge gas can flow through the slots (E8.4). The slots can hold sealant (a failure mode for Prompt 15). It can be laser-cut from the same NiTi tube stock (§7). Covers the route "no convoluted wall".
   - Genus: deflectable ring element.
   - Credibility: high; this is the form of a collet.
4. **E4.4 Conical annular disc.** *Not conceived — Q5.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a thin frustoconical annulus held at one rim. Axial load from the purge shoulder flattens the cone, moving the free rim radially. With the inner rim held, the outer rim moves outward; with the outer rim held, the inner rim moves inward.
   - Same purpose: axial over-travel load becomes radial deflection of a ring edge.
   - Changes: short axial length, and a separate fixed seat is probably needed for sealing (as E4.2). Covers the route "a disc instead of a ring".
   - Genus: deflectable ring element.
   - Credibility: moderate. Radial movement per unit of axial stroke is small at shallow cone angles. Reaching a purge gap of the order disclosed (§4) needs design work, which only the inventor can confirm.
5. **E4.5 Integral flexure section.** *Not conceived — Q5.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a thin-walled convoluted or slotted section turned or moulded as part of the core body itself, for example in PEEK or in stainless steel.
   - Same purpose: as E4.1.
   - Changes: no separate ring and no interference fit, so the core body material must be resilient. Covers the route "no separate seat ring".
   - Genus: deflectable ring element.
   - Credibility: credible for PEEK and for spring-temper stainless steel. **Not credible for brass CW614N**, whose elastic strain limit is too low for the deflections of §4.
6. **E4.6 Split wiper ring.** *Not conceived — Q5; wiper-ring form only.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a ring with one axial split that opens circumferentially under a tapered purge shoulder (E3.2). It is used only as the wiper ring behind a fixed seat.
   - Same purpose: as E4.2.
   - Changes: the split is the purge opening. Covers a variant of Alternative B.
   - Genus: deflectable ring element.
   - Credibility: credible only where sealing is done by a fixed seat. **Not credible as a one-piece seat ring**, because the split breaks the sealing edge.

#### 5. convoluted wall

1. **E5.1 Wall with one or two convolutions.** *Disclosed (§3(3)); count and profile unknown (01 Q11).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E5.2 Wall with three or more convolutions.** *Not conceived — Q5.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: the same wall, with more convolutions.
   - Same purpose: axial load becomes radial deflection.
   - Changes: more axial compliance, and less radial deflection per convolution for a given load. Covers the route "just outside a one-or-two count".
   - Genus: axial-to-radial conversion geometry.
   - Credibility: credible up to the point where the wall mainly shortens axially. Beyond that point it no longer serves the purpose.
3. **E5.3 Frustoconical wall.** *Not conceived — Q5.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a plain wall with a conical flare. Axial load at the narrow end increases the flare and moves the free end outward.
   - Same purpose: as E5.1.
   - Changes: no convolution to form, which may be simpler to make. Covers the route "no convolution".
   - Genus: axial-to-radial conversion geometry.
   - Credibility: credible.
4. **E5.4 Cellular wall.** *Not conceived — Q5.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a laser-cut pattern of diamond or chevron cells between two continuous end bands. Under axial compression the cell struts rotate and the wall enlarges radially.
   - Same purpose: as E5.1.
   - Changes: the cells pass through the wall, so they can carry the purge flow (E8.4), and the sealing edge sits on the continuous end band. It fits the inventor's laser-cutting route (§7). The cells can trap sealant. Covers the route "no convolution".
   - Genus: axial-to-radial conversion geometry.
   - Credibility: credible. Laser-cut superelastic cell structures are an established class of product. The coupling between axial shortening and radial enlargement depends on the cell geometry and would need design.
5. **E5.5 Plain wall deflected directly by a tapered purge shoulder (E3.2).** *Not conceived — Q4.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a straight-walled ring.
   - Same purpose: radial deflection without any conversion geometry.
   - Changes: the convoluted wall is not needed. Covers the route "a straight wall".
   - Genus: deflectable ring element (no wall-profile limitation).
   - Credibility: high.

**Finding for Claims Architect (subject to Gate 2).** E3.2 with E5.5 would show that the convoluted wall is a means, not an essential feature. If the inventor confirms either, the enablement risk recorded against C12 in `03` is reduced.

#### 6. radial deflection

1. **E6.1 Radially outward.** *Disclosed (§2; Alternative B, §6).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E6.2 Radially inward at the surface that bounds the purge gap.** *Not conceived — Q1, Q7.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: the part of the seat ring's outer surface that touches the core body bore at rest moves inward, away from that bore. Two mechanisms would do this: axial tension on an outward convolution, which flattens its crest, or axial compression of an inward convolution, which deepens it.
   - Same purpose: it opens a purge gap at the seat ring's outer surface. That is the location given in §3(6) and the location of the film found in the bench data.
   - Changes: the sense of deflection, and the way the purge shoulder is coupled to the ring.
   - Genus: radial deflection (the direction is neutral in LOCKED).
   - Credibility: credible mechanics. **This is offered as a candidate only. It does not resolve 01 Q1 and Q2 and must not be written into the Description as the inventor's mechanism unless the inventor confirms it.**
3. **E6.3 Ovalising deflection.** *Not conceived — Q4.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: loading at discrete points (E3.3) moves the ring outward at the load points and inward about 90° away.
   - Same purpose: it opens gaps on both the ring's inner and outer surfaces, on different arcs.
   - Changes: a non-axisymmetric purge gap.
   - Genus: radial deflection.
   - Credibility: credible; this is standard ring mechanics.

#### 7. purge gap

No surface pair is assumed here to be the inventor's. Each entry states the direction of deflection it needs, so that the inventor can pick the true one at Gate 2 (01 Q1, Q2).

1. **E7.1 Between the seat ring's outer surface and the core body bore.** *Disclosed location (§3(6)); opening mechanism unresolved.* Status: candidate.
   - Opens only by inward movement of that surface (E6.2 or E6.3). This is consistent with the film found on the ring's outer surface (bench data), and in tension with "flexes radially outward" (§2) and with the interference fit (§7) unless the fit is confined to one band (E14.2, E14.3).
2. **E7.2 Between the seat ring's outer surface and the stem bore, through windows in the core body.** *Wording of §2 ("stem bore"); not otherwise conceived — Q1.* Status: candidate.
   - Needs openings through the wall of the core body at the ring, and inward movement as in E7.1.
   - Credibility: moderate; it weakens the core body.
3. **E7.3 Between the seat ring's inner surface and the poppet, on the chamber side of the sealing edge.** *Not conceived — Q1.* Status: candidate.
   - Opens by outward deflection, as in §2. The purge flow passes along the poppet stem, which is the capillary path named in §1.
   - Credibility: moderate. The gap is distinct from the main passage only if the clearance between the ring's inner surface and the poppet is closed or very small at rest, and the disclosure does not say so.
4. **E7.4 Through-wall openings in the seat ring (E4.3, E5.4), closed at rest by contact with the core body bore and uncovered by deflection.** *Not conceived — Q14.* Status: candidate.
   - Credibility: credible if the openings sit where the wall moves away from its contact surface.

Genus for all four: a purge passage, bounded at least in part by a surface of the deflectable ring element, which is closed in the closed state and in the normal-open state and is opened by radial deflection.

#### 8. purge flow path

1. **E8.1 From the supply side through the purge gap into the inflatable chamber, alongside the main passage.** *Disclosed (§2; drawings README, FIG-2).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E8.2 Purge ports.** *Not conceived — Q14.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: radial holes or slots through the wall of the core body, on the chamber side of the purge gap, lead to the clearance between the core body and the stem bore and on to the inflatable chamber.
   - Same purpose: they carry the air purge and the dislodged sealant film into the inflatable chamber.
   - Changes: they fix where the purged sealant film leaves the valve core, and they need machining of the core body. The ports can themselves foul. Covers the route "the purge exits sideways, not axially".
   - Genus: purge flow path.
   - Credibility: high.
3. **E8.3 Flutes in the core body bore.** *Not conceived — Q14.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: axial grooves in the core body bore behind the seat ring. At rest the ring's outer surface lies on the lands between them; when that surface moves inward (E6.2), the flutes connect to the supply side.
   - Same purpose: as E8.1.
   - Changes: the flutes set the purge flow area independently of the size of the purge gap opening.
   - Genus: purge flow path.
   - Credibility: credible.
4. **E8.4 Through the wall of the seat ring (slots or cells, E4.3, E5.4).** *Not conceived — Q14.* Status: candidate.
   - Credibility: credible.
5. **E8.5 Purge gas.** *Genus note, not a structure.* Status: candidate.
   - Any inflation gas: air from a floor pump, hand pump or compressor, or gas from a compressed-CO2 inflation device. Whether a CO2 inflation device reaches the over-travel threshold is unknown, and the risk of cold to the ring is open (01 Q5, Q28). E1.5 reverses the direction of flow.

#### 9. shape recovery

1. **E9.1 Superelastic recovery of NiTi.** *Disclosed (§2).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E9.2 Elastic recovery of PEEK, slower and with less force.** *Disclosed (§6, Alternative A).* Status: candidate (baseline).
3. **E9.3 Elastic recovery of a spring metal.** *Disclosed for the stainless wiper ring (§6, Alternative B); other spring metals in E12.4.* Status: candidate.
4. **E9.4 Positively driven recovery.** *Not conceived — Q8.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a second formation on the poppet, on the opposite side of the ring from the deflecting formation, meets the ring on the return and pushes it back to its at-rest shape.
   - Same purpose: the purge gap closes when the pressure differential falls.
   - Changes: closing no longer depends only on the material's recovery, which guards against residual set (01 Q27) and against cold below the martensite start temperature (01 Q28). Covers the route "a ring that does not recover by itself".
   - Genus: elastic return, or return driven by the poppet.
   - Credibility: credible. It adds contact and friction on the return.
5. **E9.5 Recovery by warming above the austenite finish temperature.** *Related to the thermally actuated purge (§6); separate concept (03 C32) — Q12 of 03.* Status: candidate.
   - Listed only as a recovery mechanism if a ring left martensitic by chilling from a CO2 inflation device is warmed. It is not a rung of the nucleus.

#### 10. snap-back wipe

1. **E10.1 The recovering seat ring moves across the sealing face or an adjacent poppet surface.** *Disclosed (§2); geometry unknown (01 Q10).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E10.2 Wipe by the wiper ring on recovery.** *Alternative B (§6); whether it wipes is unknown (03 Q7).* Status: candidate.
3. **E10.3 Fixed wiping land.** *Not conceived — Q8.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a close-clearance land in the core body bore, or on the fixed seat, through which the poppet passes on every stroke. Relative axial movement shears the sealant film. The seat ring deflection only opens the purge gap.
   - Same purpose: mechanical removal of sealant film from the poppet.
   - Changes: the wipe no longer depends on ring recovery. Covers the route "a wipe without a recovering ring".
   - Genus: mechanical wipe.
   - Credibility: credible. The close clearance is itself a place for sealant film to collect (a failure mode for Prompt 15).
4. **E10.4 Defined wiping edge.** *Not conceived — Q8.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a sharp-cornered edge on the ring's inner surface, set by the laser-cut profile and a limited depth of electropolishing, presented to the poppet as the ring recovers.
   - Same purpose: it concentrates contact pressure, so the ring shears the sealant film rather than riding over it.
   - Changes: a trade-off against electropolishing, which rounds edges (§7).
   - Genus: snap-back wipe.
   - Credibility: credible. The purpose of electropolishing is unknown (03 Q15).
5. **E10.5 Rotational wipe.** *Not conceived — Q8.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a helical guide between the poppet stem and the core body turns the poppet a few degrees during over-travel and back again on the return, so that the sealing face rubs the sealing edge circumferentially.
   - Same purpose: mechanical removal of sealant film.
   - Changes: more friction, and wear of the sealing surfaces that may raise leak-down.
   - Genus: mechanical wipe.
   - Credibility: moderate.

#### 11. sealing face

1. **E11.1 Conical sealing face on the sealing edge, metal to metal.** *Disclosed (§3(4)); cone angle, and whether any elastomer is present, unknown (01 Q9).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E11.2 Hard-anodised aluminium sealing face.** *Disclosed (§5); not built.* Status: candidate (baseline).
3. **E11.3 Part-spherical sealing face.** *Not conceived — Q13.* Status: candidate.
   - Line contact on the sealing edge that tolerates misalignment of the poppet. Genus: sealing surface. Credibility: high.
4. **E11.4 Flat sealing face bearing on the axial end of the seat ring.** *Not conceived — Q13.* Status: candidate.
   - Genus: sealing surface. Credibility: credible. It is less self-centring, and film on the sealing surfaces has more effect on it.
5. **E11.5 Polymer sealing face, for example a PEEK facing on the poppet.** *Not conceived — Q13.* Status: candidate.
   - Lower leak-down against a metal sealing edge. Genus: sealing surface. Credibility: credible. §2's argument that latex embeds in rubber may extend to soft polymers, so the inventor must confirm.
6. **E11.6 Hard low-adhesion coating on the sealing face (for example electroless nickel or diamond-like carbon), used together with the purge.** *Not conceived — Q13.* Status: candidate.
   - §1 says that coatings used alone only slow build-up, so this is useful only in combination with the purge. Genus: sealing surface. Credibility: credible.

#### 12. superelastic alloy

1. **E12.1 Binary NiTi, nominally 55.8 wt% nickel content.** *Disclosed (§5).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E12.2 Ternary NiTi: NiTiCu for narrower hysteresis and more stable cycling; NiTiFe or NiTiCr for a lower austenite finish temperature.** *Not conceived — Q6.* Status: candidate.
   - Changes: the transformation temperatures and the plateau stress, which interact with E2.3 and section 13.
   - Genus: superelastic alloy.
   - Credibility: established alloy families. Availability as tube stock at 2.7 mm outer diameter is not verified.
3. **E12.3 Copper-based superelastic alloys (Cu-Al-Mn, Cu-Al-Ni).** *Not conceived — Q6.* Status: candidate.
   - Genus: superelastic alloy.
   - Credibility: **low with ammonia-bearing liquid sealant**, because copper alloys are attacked by ammonia. Credible only with ammonia-free liquid sealant (01 Q29).
4. **E12.4 Spring metals without a phase transformation: beta-titanium alloys, precipitation-hardened stainless steel (17-7PH), cold-worked austenitic stainless steel.** *Stainless is disclosed only for the wiper ring (§6); otherwise not conceived — Q6.* Status: candidate.
   - Changes: recoverable strain is about an order of magnitude below that of NiTi, so a thinner wall, smaller deflection or slotted form is needed (E4.3). There is no dependence on the austenite finish temperature, which avoids the cold risk of 01 Q28.
   - Genus: resilient metal.
   - Credibility: credible with a redesigned geometry.
5. **E12.5 Resilient engineering polymers: PEEK (disclosed, §6); PPS or PEI as chemically resistant alternatives.** *PPS and PEI not conceived — Q6.* Status: candidate.
   - Changes: creep under a sustained interference fit, and weaker recovery (§6).
   - Genus: resilient polymer.
   - Credibility: moderate for PPS and PEI. Resistance to ammonia-bearing liquid sealant must be checked.

#### 13. austenite finish temperature

1. **E13.1 Austenite finish temperature below 5 °C.** *Disclosed (§4).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E13.2 Lower austenite finish temperature, set by nickel content or by shape-setting time and temperature.** *Not conceived — Q6.* Status: candidate.
   - Changes: more margin against chilling by a CO2 inflation device (01 Q28). A higher plateau stress at service temperature raises the ring's contribution to the over-travel threshold (E2.3).
   - Genus: superelastic at the service temperature of the inflation valve.
   - Credibility: credible. Values are left to Prompt 13; none is asserted.
3. **E13.3 No dependence on transformation temperature: materials from E12.4 or E12.5.** Status: candidate.

#### 14. interference fit

1. **E14.1 Interference fit of about 0.03 mm on diameter, against the internal shoulder.** *Disclosed (§7).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E14.2 Crimped lip.** *Not conceived — Q10.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a lip on the core body is rolled or swaged over the end of the seat ring.
   - Same purpose: it retains the ring axially.
   - Changes: the ring's outer surface is freed from radial interference, which removes the conflict with a purge gap at the outer surface (E7.1).
   - Genus: ring retention.
   - Credibility: high; brass swages readily.
3. **E14.3 Retaining sleeve.** *Not conceived — Q10.* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: a sleeve pressed or threaded into the core body clamps the ring against the internal shoulder.
   - Same purpose and changes: as E14.2, with one more part.
   - Genus: ring retention.
   - Credibility: high.
4. **E14.4 Adhesive bond with an ammonia-resistant adhesive.** *Not conceived — Q10.* Status: candidate.
   - Genus: ring retention.
   - Credibility: moderate. Adhesion to the oxide surface of NiTi, and exposure to liquid sealant, are the risks.
5. **E14.5 Seat ring integral with the core body (E4.5).** Status: candidate.
6. **E14.6 Seat ring carried by the valve stem instead of the core body.** *Not conceived — Q12.* Status: candidate.
   - Changes: the ring becomes part of the valve stem assembly. Covers the route "a valve core without the ring" against core-level claims (02 rank 1).
   - Genus: ring retention.
   - Credibility: credible, particularly in non-removable valves (E16.3).

#### 15. shape-setting (seat ring manufacture)

1. **E15.1 Laser cutting from NiTi tube stock, shape-setting at 500 °C for 10 minutes in a fixture, water quench, then electropolishing.** *Disclosed (§7).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E15.2 Convolution formed by roll-forming with profiled rollers, in stages, with shape-setting between stages.** *Not conceived — Q11.* Status: candidate.
   - Credibility: credible. Staged forming with intermediate shape-setting is normal NiTi practice.
3. **E15.3 Convolution formed by internal pressure in a split die (hydroforming).** *Not conceived — Q11.* Status: candidate.
   - Credibility: credible for stainless steel; difficult for NiTi at room temperature.
4. **E15.4 Injection moulding of a PEEK seat ring.** *Alternative A material (§6); process not conceived — Q11.* Status: candidate.
   - Credibility: moderate. A 0.20 mm wall over a free length of 3.0 mm is micro-moulding territory.
5. **E15.5 Stamping or deep drawing from strip.** *Not conceived — Q11.* Status: candidate.
   - For a stainless wiper ring (E4.2) or a conical annular disc (E4.4). Credibility: high.
6. **E15.6 Photochemical etching of flat sheet for slotted or cellular patterns, then rolling and joining.** *Not conceived — Q11.* Status: candidate.
   - Credibility: high for stainless steel. Moderate for NiTi, because of the fatigue life of the seam weld.
7. **E15.7 Mechanical or chemical polishing in place of electropolishing.** *Not conceived — Q11.* Status: candidate.
   - The function of electropolishing is unknown (03 Q15). Credibility: credible.

#### 16. valve core

1. **E16.1 Presta-pattern valve core that can be removed from the valve stem.** *Disclosed (§3).* Status: candidate (baseline).
2. **E16.2 Schrader-pattern valve core.** *Not conceived — Q12 (01 Q26).* Status: candidate.
   - Changes: a larger bore, which gives room for E1.2. The core pin is depressed by the head (E1.4).
   - Genus: valve mechanism.
   - Credibility: credible.
3. **E16.3 Non-removable inflation valve.** *Not conceived — Q12 (01 Q33).* Status: candidate.
   - Structure: the seat ring, poppet and return spring are carried directly in the valve stem, with no separate core body.
   - Changes: covers the route "no valve core" against core-level claims.
   - Genus: valve mechanism.
   - Credibility: high.

**Findings for Claims Architect (each only if confirmed at Gate 2).**
- E2.3: the second spring stage may not be needed as a separate part, which supports functional language for the threshold (02 rank 7; 03 C3).
- E3.2 and E5.5: the convoluted wall is a means, not an essential feature.
- E1.2 and E1.3: the deflecting formation need not be on the poppet.
- E10.3: a mechanical wipe is possible without ring recovery.
- E1.4: the pressure threshold can be avoided by mechanical actuation.
- E14.6 and E16.3: core-level claims can be avoided by moving the ring into the valve stem.

### Parameter Ladders

Status: candidate. This is a drafting and analysis aid prepared by AI. It says nothing about patentability and is not legal advice; qualified patent counsel signs off before anything is filed. Nothing in this deliverable is confirmed: every proposed rung is a candidate until Human Gate 2 decides it is technically real and within what the inventor has conceived.

**Sources.** `intake/disclosure.md` is cited §1–§9; `intake/data/bench-test.md` as "bench data"; `runs/r1/P1/01.md` and `03.md` as "01 (x)" / "03 (x)"; `terminology/LOCKED.md` as "locked". Prompts 02 (commercial value), 09 and 10 (prior-art differentiation, white space) were not available and are not used. Only §4's parameters carry an inventor-stated broad range ("the ranges we believe would work"); every other numeric parameter in the disclosure is a single prototype or test value with no stated range.

**Method for proposed rungs.** Where §4 gives a broad range [L, U] and a prototype (representative) value R, this analysis proposes: intermediate range = the middle band spanning 60% of (U − L), centred on R and clipped to [L, U]; preferred range = the middle band spanning 25% of (U − L), centred on R and clipped to [L, U]. This is a drafting convention for generating nested fallback positions from a single disclosed range and a single worked example; it is not itself data, is not derived from any calculation or test, and every cell built this way is marked "needs confirmation" below. No value outside the inventor's stated broad range is proposed for any parameter, and no range is proposed at all for a parameter that has no stated range to interpolate from.

#### Table 1 — Parameters with an inventor-stated broad range (§4), proposed ladder

| Parameter (locked term) | Unit | Broad range | Intermediate range | Preferred range | Endpoints | Representative value | Source | Confirmation needed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Combination Matrix

Status: candidate. Nothing in this section is confirmed; every combination and every draft sentence below is a candidate pending Human Gate 2, and pending the inventor's answers to the questions cited. This is a drafting and analysis aid prepared by AI. It is not legal advice and makes no statement about patentability; qualified patent counsel signs off before anything is filed.

**Inputs used.** `runs/r1/P3/12.md` (equivalent architecture library) and `runs/r1/P2/10.md` (prior-art white space) do not yet exist, so the core-embodiment columns below are built only from the nucleus ladder in `03` and the inventor's own §6 alternatives, not from a fuller equivalents library or a white-space-driven set of design-around embodiments. See Assumption A1 and Open Question Q7. This map should be revisited once `12` and `10` exist.

**Core embodiments (columns).** Three structurally distinct embodiments are read from `01`/`03`, all sharing the essential nucleus (N0: over-travel, purge shoulder, deflectable ring element, purge gap, air purge, recovery):

- **E-I — superelastic seat ring embodiment.** The seat ring is a single part that both seats the poppet and is deflected during over-travel (nucleus rung N2 onward, materialised in NiTi at N4–N7; §2, §3(3)–(4), §4, §5, §7).
- **E-II — PEEK seat ring embodiment.** Same one-piece seat-ring structure as E-I (nucleus through N3, "the same convoluted wall"), with the seat ring formed from PEEK instead of a superelastic alloy (§6, Alternative A).
- **E-III — fixed seat and wiper ring embodiment.** Sealing is performed by a rigid fixed seat; a separate wiper ring, deflected outward by the purge shoulder, opens the purge gap (nucleus through N1 only; excluded from N2 onward). One more part and more axial length than E-I/E-II (§6, Alternative B).

**Optional features (rows).** Drawn from `03`'s advantageous/exemplary classification (C9–C30) and from the optional components in `01`(e), limited to features that are not already part of a core embodiment's own structural definition.

| # | Optional feature (source) | E-I: superelastic seat ring | E-II: PEEK seat ring | E-III: fixed seat + wiper ring | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Snap-back wipe as a claimed effect (C9; §2) | Compatible | Conditional [a] | Conditional [b] | candidate |
| 2 | Convoluted wall geometry on the deflectable ring element (C12/C13; §3(3)) | Compatible | Compatible | Conditional [c] | candidate |
| 3 | Two-rate return spring / threshold arrangement (C17; §3(5)) | Compatible | Compatible | Compatible | candidate |
| 4 | Prototype-derived pressure and dimensional ranges, N6 (C19–C21; §4) | Compatible (basis of the ranges) | Conditional [d] | Conditional [d] | candidate |
| 5 | Stainless 303 core body (F1; §5) | Compatible | Compatible | Compatible | candidate |
| 6 | Hard-anodised aluminium sealing face on the poppet (F2; §5) | Compatible | Compatible | Compatible | candidate |
| 7 | Electropolished surface finish on the deflectable ring element (C25; §7) | Compatible | **Incompatible** [e] | Conditional [f] | candidate |
| 8 | Lock nut (C30; §3(7)) | Compatible | Compatible | Compatible | candidate |
| 9 | Austenite finish temperature (Af) below 5 °C specification (C16; §4) | Compatible (essential if a shape-memory alloy is used) | **Incompatible** [g] | **Incompatible** [h] | candidate |

**Footnotes (conditional and incompatible cells).**

- **[a]** §6 states the PEEK seat ring gives "some radial compliance, but recovery is slower and snap-back force lower, so the wipe is weaker." The wipe is not excluded, but it is degraded, and no lower bound on wipe force is disclosed. A sentence claiming the wipe for E-II must not assert it is as effective as in E-I. See Q1.
- **[b]** Whether the wiper ring of E-III wipes the poppet face on recovery, and if so which surface moves across which, is not stated in the disclosure (`03` Q7). Marked conditional rather than compatible until the inventor confirms. See Q1 below.
- **[c]** §6 says the wiper ring is "deflected outward" but does not state its wall form. A convoluted wall is a candidate way to achieve that deflection by analogy with E-I/E-II, but it is not disclosed for the wiper ring. See Q2.
- **[d]** The N6 ranges (crack pressure, over-travel threshold, over-travel distance, purge gap opening, ring dimensions) were derived against the NiTi seat ring's stiffness and recovery behaviour. PEEK's lower stiffness and slower recovery (§6), and the extra part and axial length of E-III (§6), make it technically uncertain whether the same numeric ranges hold. Flagged for inventor confirmation, not asserted. See Q3.
- **[e]** Electropolishing is an electrochemical metal-finishing process that removes surface oxide by anodic dissolution; it has no counterpart process for a polymer such as PEEK. Marking this cell compatible would assert a technically incoherent permutation. This is a general materials-science fact about the named process, not an invented fact about the invention.
- **[f]** The disclosed E-III wiper ring is "stainless" (§6), i.e. a metal, so electropolishing is technically feasible on it, but the disclosure does not describe this step for the wiper ring. Marked conditional, not compatible, until confirmed. See Q5.
- **[g]** Af is a transformation temperature of a shape-memory/superelastic alloy. PEEK is a thermoplastic polymer with a glass transition temperature, not an alloy transformation temperature; it does not have an Af. Asserting an Af specification for the PEEK ring would be technically incoherent.
- **[h]** The wiper ring of E-III is disclosed only as "stainless spring" (§6), read as conventional spring steel, not a superelastic alloy. As disclosed, no Af applies. A superelastic wiper-ring species is conceptually possible but is not in the disclosure. See Q4.

#### Commercially important or patentably distinct combinations

Ranking basis: `02`'s commercial value map and `03`'s rung ordering (which shows E-II and E-III are the inventor's own named design-arounds).

| # | Combination | Core embodiment | Optional features | Why important / distinct | Rests on | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CB1 | Full nucleus product | E-I | Rows 3, 4, 8, 9 (two-rate spring, N6 ranges, lock nut, Af < 5 °C) | This is the tested, evidenced embodiment and the main commercial product (`02` rank 1–2; bench data, 40-cycle result) | §2–§5, §7, §4; bench data | candidate |
| CB2 | Corrosion-resistant line | E-I | Row 5 (stainless 303 core body) | Named premium variant for ammonia-bearing sealant (`02` rank 9); independent of ring material, so also combinable with E-II/E-III | §5 (F1) | candidate |
| CB3 | Lower-cost line | E-II | Rows 2, 3, 8 (convoluted wall, two-rate spring, lock nut); **not** row 9 (Af) | Inventor's own named cost-reduction design-around (`02` rank 5, `03` N4 exclusion); closes a design-around a competitor could otherwise use to avoid a superelastic-alloy limitation | §6 (Alternative A) | candidate |
| CB4 | Design-around-closing split architecture | E-III | Rows 3, 5, 8 (two-rate spring, stainless body, lock nut); rows 1, 2, 7 only as conditional/candidate pending Q1–Q2, Q5 | Inventor's own named structural design-around separating sealing from purge/wipe (`02` rank 6, `03` N2 exclusion); the claim family most likely to catch a competitor who splits the seat and wiper into two parts specifically to avoid a one-piece-ring claim | §6 (Alternative B) | candidate |
| CB5 | Retrofit core, ring-material-agnostic | E-I or E-II or E-III | Row 8 (lock nut) only, core sold without the valve stem | Independent replacement-core product line (`02` rank 1); demonstrates that ring-material and architecture choice are orthogonal to the stem-inclusion claim strategy question raised in `02` Q1 | §1 ("cores are sold in multipacks"); `01` Q33 | candidate |

#### Draft specification language

Each sentence is a candidate for the Description, written in locked terms, and is expressly scoped so that it does not assert an incompatible permutation (rows 7 and 9, footnotes [e]–[h]).

1. "In some embodiments, the deflectable ring element is a seat ring formed from a superelastic alloy, such as NiTi, having an austenite finish temperature below 5 °C; in other embodiments, the deflectable ring element is a seat ring formed from a polymer, such as PEEK, or is a wiper ring separate from a fixed seat." — supports CB1/CB3/CB4 as alternative species of the same genus, without tying the polymer or wiper-ring species to the Af limitation. (Rows 1, 9)

2. "Where the deflectable ring element is formed from a superelastic alloy, the alloy is selected to have an austenite finish temperature below a threshold, such as 5 °C, so that the ring element remains superelastic across the intended range of ambient temperatures." — conditions the Af limitation expressly on the superelastic-alloy species, consistent with footnotes [g]/[h]. (Row 9)

3. "The core body may be formed from a corrosion-resistant material, such as stainless steel, independently of whether the deflectable ring element is a superelastic seat ring, a polymer seat ring, or a wiper ring used together with a separate fixed seat." — supports CB2 as combinable across all three core embodiments. (Row 5)

4. "The convoluted wall geometry described herein for converting axial load into radial deflection may be applied to a seat ring that also performs a sealing function, or, in embodiments having a separate fixed seat, to a wiper ring that performs the purging and wiping function without also sealing." — supports extending row 2 to E-III as a candidate, expressly flagged in the Description as a candidate application rather than a confirmed one, pending Q2. (Row 2)

5. "A lock nut for manually holding the poppet closed may be combined with any of the seat ring, PEEK seat ring, or fixed-seat-and-wiper-ring embodiments described herein." — supports CB5 and row 8 generally. (Row 8)

6. "In embodiments in which the deflectable ring element is a polymer, such as PEEK, the recovery on release of the pressure differential may be slower and the resulting wipe weaker than in embodiments using a superelastic alloy; the purge gap and air purge nonetheless provide cleaning independently of the wipe." — supports CB3 while expressly avoiding an assertion that the PEEK embodiment wipes as effectively as the superelastic embodiment, consistent with footnote [a]. (Row 1)

7. "The dimensions and pressure thresholds given in the examples herein correspond to the superelastic seat ring embodiment; a person skilled in the art will adapt them to the stiffness and recovery characteristics of a polymer seat ring or of a separate wiper ring." — avoids asserting the N6 ranges apply unmodified to E-II/E-III, consistent with footnote [d]. (Row 4)

## From `15.md`

**Status: candidate.** This is a drafting and analysis aid prepared by AI. Nothing below is confirmed, tested or asserted as fact about the invention; it is a competitor/engineer stress-test of the nucleus and confirmed vocabulary. Every row is a candidate until Human Gate 2 confirms it is technically real and within what the inventor has conceived. Qualified patent counsel signs off before anything is filed.

**Sources.** `runs/r1/P1/01.md` (cited as 01), `runs/r1/P1/03.md` (cited as 03), `runs/r1/terminology/LOCKED.md` (locked terms used verbatim), `intake/data/bench-test.md` (cited as bench data). `runs/r1/P3/12.md` and `13.md` (equivalent architectures, parameter ladders) and `runs/r1/P2/09.md`/`10.md` (differentiation, white space) do not exist yet; this analysis proceeds without them, from the nucleus (03) and the disclosure (01) alone. Gate 1 answers (`intake/answers.md`) also do not exist yet, so every open question from 01 and 03 that this list touches is still open.

### Failure-Mode Embodiments

| ID | Failure mode / abuse case | Cause | Technical mitigation | Disclose as | Support |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FM-1 | Purge gap region progressively fouls despite the cleaning actions: cured sealant film accumulates on the seat ring outer surface in the purge-gap region over many inflation events | The air purge and snap-back wipe act mainly at the sealing edge and across the purge flow path; sealant may re-deposit in the purge-gap region faster than it is cleared there, even while the sealing edge and poppet face stay clean | Enlarge the purge gap opening toward the higher end of the disclosed range (0.10–0.25 mm) to raise clearance and purge-flow velocity in that region; extend the disclosed electropolish (§7) to the adjoining core body bore surface to reduce adhesion where the film was found | Alternative embodiment (larger purge gap; treated bore surface) and dependent-claim fallback (purge gap size toward the upper end of §4's range) | Bench data (film found on the ring outer surface in the purge-gap region at cycle 40, sealing edge and poppet face clean); §4 range; §7 electropolish. Extension of electropolish to the core body bore is candidate – needs confirmation |
| FM-2 | Purge gap fails to open at all: cured sealant bridges the closed gap before over-travel is reached, resisting or blocking radial deflection | If the closed-gap region is not itself kept clear by either cleaning action, a hardened bridge could form there specifically, since it is closed (and therefore not purged) whenever the valve is not over-travelling | Not established in the disclosure; candidate only: the repeated snap-back wipe already occurring on every recovery (§2) may itself prevent hardening from setting in the closed gap, but this is not tested at cycle counts beyond 40 | Dependent-claim fallback reciting a purge-gap geometry or finish that resists sealant ingress at rest, once the inventor confirms whether this occurs | Candidate – needs confirmation; relates to 01 Q30 (long-term effect of the observed film) |
| FM-3 | Seat ring fatigue crack in the convoluted wall after cycling beyond the 40 cycles tested, causing loss of sealing or a ring fragment entering the sealant/tube | Repeated radial flexing concentrates strain at the convolution root; §9 names fatigue life as an unresolved question and the bench data confirms no fatigue testing was done | Not disclosed; candidate: a fillet radius at the convolution root, or distributing strain across two convolutions rather than one (§3(3) leaves the count unstated) | Dependent-claim fallback (convolution root geometry; convolution count) once the inventor supplies a mechanism; flag actual fatigue life as an open question rather than asserting a mitigation works | §9 item 1 (fatigue life open); bench data (no fatigue testing); §3(3) (count unstated, 01 Q11). Mitigation is candidate – needs confirmation |
| FM-4 | Seat ring chilled below its martensite start temperature by CO2 inflation while over-travelled, so it does not fully recover shape (superelastic recovery lost) | §9 item 2 raises CO2 cold-shock as untested; adiabatic expansion from a CO2 cartridge can cool the valve significantly | Not disclosed; candidate only: specifying an Af/Ms margin below the coldest expected CO2-inflation temperature (no such data exists in the dossier) | Dependent-claim fallback (Af with a stated cold-inflation margin) once the inventor supplies the transformation temperatures; not an embodiment without that data | §9 item 2; §4 (Af "below 5 °C", no lower bound). Mitigation is candidate – needs confirmation (relates to 01 Q13, Q28) |
| FM-5 | Ring loses shape recovery from ordinary cold-climate storage or riding, by the same mechanism as FM-4 but without CO2 | §4 gives only an upper bound on Af ("below 5 °C"); no As, Ms or Mf value is given, so the margin against ordinary cold weather is unknown | Same candidate mitigation as FM-4 | Same as FM-4 | §4; candidate – needs confirmation (01 Q13) |
| FM-6 | Seat ring loosens, rotates or migrates axially in the core body bore after repeated thermal cycling or vibration, drifting the purge-gap geometry or, in the worst case, coming free into the sealant/tube | Retention relies solely on an interference fit of about 0.03 mm (§7) with no process range or supplementary retention given (01 Q15, Q16) | Not disclosed; candidate: a supplementary ring retention feature in addition to the interference fit — for example adhesive bonding, a crimped lip on the core body, or a snap-fit groove | Dependent-claim fallback (interference fit is one species of a broader ring retention genus) and alternative embodiment for the supplementary feature | §7 (interference fit only); 01 Q17 (already raises alternative retention methods). Mitigation is candidate – needs confirmation |
| FM-7 | Interference fit manufactured at the tight end of an unstated tolerance over-constrains the ring, suppressing radial deflection (reduced or absent purge gap opening), or cracks the ring during press-fit assembly | No tolerance band is given for the ~0.03 mm interference (01 Q15) | Not disclosed; candidate: a specified interference tolerance band and an assembly force/travel check | Dependent-claim fallback specifying an interference range, once supplied; not worth disclosing as an embodiment without the range | §7; candidate – needs confirmation (01 Q15, Q17) |
| FM-8 | Sealing-edge wear or galling from repeated metal-to-metal contact between the brass sealing face and the seat ring sealing edge over the product's service life, degrading the at-rest seal independent of sealant fouling | At-rest sealing is direct metal-to-metal contact with no elastomer (§3(4)); the commercial target is "several thousand" cycles (§9) against only 40 tested | A hard-anodised aluminium sealing face (already disclosed, §5, Alternative F2) or a wear-resistant finish on the poppet sealing face | Alternative embodiment (F2 already in the dossier; confirm whether it was built, per 01 Q19) and dependent-claim fallback (wear-resistant sealing-face material) | §5 (Alternative F2, not confirmed tested per 01 Q19); §9 (cycle target) |
| FM-9 | Over-pressurisation beyond the believed over-travel threshold range (for example rapid inflation from a shop compressor) strains the seat ring beyond its superelastic limit if nothing else limits poppet travel | 01 Q36 and 03 note that what limits over-travel — a mechanical stop, spring coil-bind, or the ring itself — is not stated | A positive over-travel stop (a stop shoulder in the core body bore, or designed coil-bind of the second spring stage) limiting poppet travel independently of the seat ring | Alternative embodiment (structural over-travel stop) and dependent-claim fallback | Candidate – needs confirmation; directly answers the unresolved 01 Q36 / 03 (what limits over-travel) |
| FM-10 | Rapid, repeated pump-head engagement and disengagement drives many over-travel cycles in a short period, a duty cycle not represented by the tested protocol | The bench test ran one inflation event per 24-hour hold (§8); higher-frequency actuation is not addressed | None disclosed beyond the ring's inherent design | Not worth disclosing as a structural embodiment; dependent-claim fallback limiting claimed cycle life to what was tested (40 cycles), if broader endurance claims are challenged | §8 (protocol); candidate |
| FM-11 | Cross-threading or over-torquing the valve core into the stem bore during installation or removal distorts the core body bore, shifting the interference fit or the purge-gap geometry | No installation torque specification is given; metal-on-metal threading into the valve stem is common practice but easy to over-tighten | Not disclosed; candidate: a torque-limiting feature such as a shoulder that bottoms out at a defined torque | Not worth disclosing without inventor confirmation; raise as an open question rather than an embodiment | Candidate – needs confirmation; no support in the dossier |
| FM-12 | A valve cap or accessory with an internal pin holds the poppet in a partially or fully over-travelled state during storage or transport, subjecting the ring to sustained (non-transient) deflection | Not addressed by the disclosure; ordinary caps can contact the poppet tip | The lock nut (70), already disclosed for storage and transport (§3(7)), holds the poppet fully closed rather than over-travelled | Alternative embodiment note (recommended use of the existing lock nut for storage); not worth a separate dependent claim | §3(7) (lock nut function) |
| FM-13 | A higher-viscosity or particulate-laden sealant, or a non-latex formulation with abrasive fillers, abrades the sealing edge or lodges in the purge gap and prevents full closure | Only one unnamed latex sealant was tested (01 Q23); §9 raises ammonia-free sealants as untested and does not address particulate size at all | Not disclosed; no dimensional adjustment is asserted without data | Not worth disclosing as an embodiment; raise as an open question for Gate 2 | §9; candidate – needs confirmation |
| FM-14 | Manufacturing variability in shape-setting temperature, time or quench rate shifts a production unit's austenite finish temperature (Af) above the "below 5 °C" specification, so that unit is not superelastic at ordinary riding temperatures | §7 gives only the prototype's single process point (500 °C, 10 min, water quench); no process window or tolerance is given (01 Q32) | Not disclosed; candidate: a specified process window validated to hold Af below a target, with sampled or full Af verification during manufacture | Dependent-claim fallback (Af tolerance/verification) once a process window is supplied; not a structural embodiment | §7; candidate – needs confirmation (01 Q32) |
| FM-15 | Manufacturing variability in the convolution profile (laser-cut kerf width, mandrel-forming inconsistency) produces convolution amplitude outside the believed 0.08–0.20 mm range, so units purge at the wrong pressure or open the wrong gap size | 01 Q11 notes the process step that actually forms the convolution (laser cut, mandrel, or shape-set fixture) is ambiguous in §7 | Not disclosed; candidate: a tighter manufacturing tolerance on convolution amplitude, or a post-forming dimensional check before shape-setting | Dependent-claim fallback (narrower convolution-amplitude tolerance); not an alternative embodiment | §4 (range); §7 (ambiguous process); candidate |
| FM-16 | Second spring stage manufacturing variability shifts the over-travel threshold outside the believed 2.5–5.0 bar range, so some units purge too early (reduced normal-stroke range) or too late (some pumps never reach the threshold, per 01 Q5) | No manufacturing tolerance is given for the return spring's second stage (01 Q7) | Not disclosed; candidate: spring-rate sorting or verification during assembly | Dependent-claim fallback narrowing the over-travel threshold range; not an embodiment without further data | §4; candidate – needs confirmation |
| FM-17 | Electropolishing removes more material than intended, locally thinning the convoluted wall — especially at the convolution root — below the believed 0.15–0.30 mm range, lowering fatigue margin exactly where FM-3 concentrates strain | §7 states electropolishing removes oxide and the heat-affected edge but gives no depth, time or tolerance (01 Q32) | Not disclosed; candidate: a specified electropolish depth/time window verified by post-process wall-thickness sampling | Dependent-claim fallback (wall thickness within §4's range, measured post-electropolish); not an embodiment | §7; §4 (range); candidate |
| FM-18 | Stress-corrosion attack on brass components (core body, poppet) from prolonged exposure to ammonia-bearing sealant | Brass alloys are generally known to be susceptible to stress-corrosion (season) cracking in ammoniacal environments — background engineering knowledge, not an inventor-supplied fact. The disclosure itself is consistent with this concern: Alternative F1 (stainless 303 core body) is offered "for corrosion resistance with ammonia-bearing sealant" (§5), and the sealant contains ammonia (§1) | The stainless 303 core body, already disclosed as Alternative F1 (§5) | Alternative embodiment (F1 is already in the dossier); also a dependent-claim fallback (stainless core body material). Recommend confirming whether F1 was ever built into a working, tested core (01 Q18) | §5 (F1); §1 (ammonia sealant). The stress-corrosion mechanism itself is general materials-science background, not from the dossier, and is flagged as such — not asserted to occur in this product without inventor confirmation |
| FM-19 | First inflation after long-term flat storage meets a harder-than-normal sealant plug near the valve, needing more force to open than a routine ride-to-ride inflation | §1 describes capillary ingress and drying generally; only 24-hour hold cycles were tested (§8), not extended flat storage | None disclosed beyond the air purge and snap-back wipe already claimed for routine fouling; not tested at this extreme | Not worth a separate embodiment; a description-level note on the operating condition, and an open question for Gate 2 on whether long-term flat storage was ever tested | §1; §8 (only 24 h holds tested); candidate |
| FM-20 | A user inserts a sharp tool into the valve core bore out of habit from servicing conventional cores, scratching, denting or puncturing the thin convoluted wall | The invention's purpose is removing tool-based servicing (§1, §2), but a user unaware of that, or troubleshooting something else, might still probe the core | None structural; a description-level caution against tool insertion is not a technical mitigation | Not worth disclosing as an embodiment or claim; at most a cautionary note in the description | §2 (thin wall, §4: 0.15–0.30 mm); not a claim-worthy mitigation |
| FM-21 | The poppet itself sticks in its fit within the core body from sealant that migrated along the poppet by capillary action, independent of the seat-ring cleaning mechanism | §1 states sealant is drawn in "by the pressure surge and by capillary action along the poppet stem"; the disclosed air purge and snap-back wipe act at the seat ring and purge gap, and no cleaning action along the poppet's fit within the core body is described | Not disclosed; candidate: extending a wiping or clearance feature to the poppet's fit within the core body, or additional running clearance there | Not worth disclosing as an embodiment without inventor input; raise as an open question, since this could be a gap in the invention's coverage of the very problem §1 describes | §1 (capillary ingress along the poppet); candidate – needs confirmation |
| FM-22 | If the closed purge gap is not itself airtight, it becomes a route for pressure loss distinct from the sealing edge, in any embodiment where sealing does not depend solely on the sealing edge | 01 Q31 and 03 Q11 leave open whether the closed purge gap must itself be airtight, or whether sealing depends solely on the sealing edge | None needed under the working assumption (03 A5, this analysis) that the sealing edge is the sole seal and the closed purge gap is a secondary flow path only when open; recommend the specification state this explicitly | Not an embodiment; a drafting/disclosure note to avoid an enablement gap | Candidate – needs confirmation (01 Q31, 03 Q11) |

## Files to write

Write each of these with your Write tool, at exactly this path, one file per call (the folders exist). Write nothing outside the run folder `{R}`. Do not run the checks yourself: the runner runs them and will tell you if anything fails.

- `/Users/ahmed/PatentCouncil/matters/valve-oc-20260930/runs/r1/debate/d2-attack.md`

When every file is written, reply with one line per file (path and a few words on what it holds) and anything the runner must route: open questions, disclosure requests, open disagreements, narrowing suggested. Nothing else.
